We protect people’s savings and help them make the purchases — from everyday transactions to buying a home — that improve the quality of their lives. We advise people on how to invest for future needs, such as their children’s education and their own retirement, and help them buy securities such as stocks and bonds. We work with companies to optimize their daily operations, whether they need working capital, to make payroll or export their goods overseas. By lending to companies large and small, we help them grow, creating jobs and real economic value at home and in communities around the world. We provide financing and support to governments at all levels, so they can build sustainable infrastructure, such as housing, transportation, schools and other vital public works. These capabilities create an obligation to act responsibly, do everything possible to create the best outcomes and prudently manage risk. If we fall short, we will take decisive action and learn from our experience We strive to earn and maintain the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards. We ask our colleagues to ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in our clients’ interests, create economic value and are always systemically responsible.

41,"global insights citigps are markets starting to envisage changing roles of telecoms and tech. Are Markets Starting to Envisage Changing Roles of Telecoms and Tech? - CitiGPSOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle08 May 2018First Activist Victory Linked to Telecom Break Up: Five Questions for InvestorsCiti GPS OpinionCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsShareAre Markets Starting to Validate our DIGITECCS Vision?Telecom valuations have been under pressure for some time, which is consistent with our strategy views on the telecom sector1. Earlier this year we pointed to the vulnerability of the global tech industry while suggesting solutions based on our DIGITECCS framework.2 Our DIGITECCS (DIGItal TEChnology, Connectivity and Service) vision calls for deep telecom infrastructure sharing on the one hand and investment in digital consumer platforms and smart industrial Internet networks by telecoms, tech, and other industries, on the other. This would lead to markets in connectivity-linked tech/software services that are more diverse than the ones we have today. We think that such a setup may better suit digitally-savvy nations and we think recent events, market moves and investor sentiment are moving positively towards such a vision. The recent selloff of the world’s leading Internet/tech stocks, including Google and Facebook, may be a sign that investors are starting to expect potential (regulatory-invoked) changes to the big tech business models. A change in regulatory emphasis away from net neutrality towards regulating data security is already underway in the U.S. and beyond. If the origins of such a change lie in efforts to tackle market dominance and possibly excessive power of the world leaders in software, platforms, tech and big data, new opportunities in those areas may arise for other players including telecoms.   Recent weakness in European telecom stocks show that investors’ backing for the legacy telecom business model, centered on monetization of existing infrastructure assets through vertical integration with services, may be fading. As of the end of March 2018, each of Europe’s top four telecom incumbents (Deutsche Telekom, BT, Telefonica and Orange) lost value in local currency terms on a 3-month and 12-month basis. Moreover, the two less fiber-focused incumbents, Deutsche Telekom and BT, also underperformed the MSCI EU Telecom index, MSCI Europe index, and MSCI World Telecom Service index in both time periods.",500
42,"  $12 billion of new money has recently been committed by investors to structural separation-like (i.e. deep infrastructure sharing) transformation of telecoms in up to six European countries. On March 21st a Czech private equity group PPF agreed to buy Telenor’s telecom assets in Hungary, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Montenegro for $3.4 billion. PPF believes in structural separation, which it successfully pioneered at O2 Czech Republic in 2015. On February 12th, TDC of Denmark accepted a $6.7 billion offer from an infrastructure investor, Macquarie, and Danish pension funds. Inspired by the Czech case, the acquirers outlined their plan to structurally separate TDC. Finally, after acquiring a stake in Telecom Italia, Elliott Advisers, an activist investor, announced on March 16th its intention to push for changes that include structural separation. Elliott Advisers currently owns a stake worth an estimated $1.9 billion in Telecom Italia. All this coincides with the EU plans to promote a wholesale-only (structurally separated) model. According to Reuters an agreement was reached in the European Parliament on March 21st to encourage such model by giving wholesale- only network companies (NetCos) regulatory benefit in a new code to be passed later this year. All three main types of telecom M&A in the past two years are consistent with our DIGITECCS vision. The most typical telecom deals in the past two years were:(1) in-market consolidation (i.e. convergence to our deep infrastructure sharing vision, e.g. India); (2) investments into upwards vertical expansion in services (consistent with our digital platforms vison, e.g. US telecoms); and (3) divestments by multi- national operators (consistent with a view that legacy telecom models are also being challenged on the cross-border synergies side, e.g. the Nordic telecoms).   Based on our recent surveys, financial investors are beginning to support digital investments, deep infrastructure sharing, and FTTH/P investments by telecoms, despite short-term risks and profit concerns. Our global e-mail survey showed that 67% of investors think that telecoms would benefit from giving up control to share some infrastructure. 61% believe that telecoms should not oppose government FTTH/P bias, if confronted with it, and instead focus on achieving the best regulatory conditions and returns within such ‘fiber framework’.",491
43,"Electronic voting at our recent London telecom conference showed that 72% of investors want BT to keep or accelerate its FTTH/P plans, 68% want KPN to replace its copper by FTTH/P (if NPV positive) and 56% support Altice’s FTTH/P upgrades in the U.S., although all this would negatively impact short-term cash flows. Interestingly, financial investors also see fiber and 5G capital expenditure as the main risk and a reason not to invest in telecoms (56% for Deutsche Telekom and 49% for BT). This implies that investors in Europe are beginning to see FTTH/P as an inevitable short-term cash flow burden. Finally, our e-mail survey showed that a majority of investors (70%) support our thesis of material expansion by telecoms into digital services, but only 46% think that telecoms should aim at freer service regulation by offering concessions in infrastructure. Only 42% agree that telecoms should reform radically. Strategic Optionality Discount May Explain Low Telecom ValuationsWhy are private equity, infrastructure and activist investors suddenly interested in European telecoms? Why are telecoms in the U.S. and some other countries willing to commit material capital towards expansion into digital platforms, content, and even artificial intelligence? Finally, why are some of the established telecoms, which are meeting their financial plans, frustrated from a lack of appreciation by the stock markets? All these questions have in our view one common answer, which is Strategic Optionality Discount. To explain this, let's first look at how stock markets value tech companies: Share Price = Financial Outlook Based Value + Strategic Optionality Premium   Financial Outlook-Based Value is based on a reasonably predictable outlook for profits and cash flows from the existing business. The Strategic Optionality Premium is based on the companies' envisaged ability to find new opportunities, and possibly also deal with threats. This relates to (1) envisaged business synergies; (2) entry barriers; (3) management's strategic and execution capabilities; (4) perceived ability to respond to change; (5) corporate culture and flexibility; and (6) influence on policies etc. Similarly, stock markets may see telecoms as follows:   Share Price = Financial Outlook-Based Value - Strategic Optionality Discount   Management incentives at telecom companies are usually based on the former, which is seemingly not fully aligned with shareholder interests. Similarly to tech, the latter includes expectations ranging from future synergies up to influence on policies.",500
44,"  It also includes expectations about management's ability to respond to external changes in technologies, consumer behavior, monetary policies, government infrastructure policies etc. Historical precedent has so far made stock markets much less optimistic about Strategic Optionality Value for telecoms vs. tech. The scale to which markets penalize telecoms may be right or wrong. However, the fact that telecom valuations have been under pressure for a longer period and some operators, including the U.S. ones, are responding with bold strategic moves while new investors are taking positions in some European telecoms to drive strategic changes, in our view makes Strategic Optionality Discount an important topic for both telecom companies and investors.   Why Do the Established Roles of Telecoms and Tech Need to Change?   Revolutionary changes often happen fast, but foundation for them can build over decades. Consumers associate the Internet with services such as Google, Facebook or e-shopping and possibly with phones such as Apple and Samsung. They tend to pay somewhat less attention to telecom products and brands, because telecoms are seen only as providers of connectivity, which is deemed a utility, and hence draws attention mainly when it goes wrong. While our surveys from 2014 and 2016 showed that 30-50% of investors saw telecoms as utility proxies, most operators would disagree with such position. Given their limited ability to create differentiated products most telecoms instead focus on aggregation, i.e., selling third party innovation ranging from phones and sport videos to software. Meanwhile, most of the capital in the telecom industry remains tied up in relatively old and simple assets such as decades-old copper networks, originally built as state monopolies, and some of the technologically simplest products of the building industry, i.e., towers and fiber networks, or spectrum.   Can companies who have so far focused largely on laying cables, building towers, and buying spectrum, be reasonably expected to become successful aggregators of innovative digital services? We think that this may be almost impossible without radical transformation. By strongly linking their infrastructure to services, telecoms would not only limit their service scale economies (to areas where they have infrastructure), but naturally also attract regulatory attention, because using their advantage in oligopoly- prone infrastructure as an entry barrier into services will always be seen as problematic.   This perhaps explains why stock markets are burdening telecoms with the Strategic Optionality Discount. Telecoms may need to make their strategies more credible rather than just talking about service bundling (aggregation).",494
45,"Meanwhile, the recent stock market moves show that big tech may have to deal with fresh regulatory and strategic challenges, which are emerging in response to major market share successes, and hence a growing influence of the leading players. Such pressures on both industries to change are further underlined by the envisaged arrival of industrial Internet, 5G, and digitalization across different segments of the economy, as well as new challenges around data protection and cybersecurity.   Four Key Stakeholders in Digital Connectivity Transformation   We see four key stakeholders driving the change in the telecom and Internet industries:(1) established telecoms and cable providers, which currently control most of the infrastructure and a large part of the infrastructure investment; (2) the infrastructure community, which often favors fiber, shared infrastructure, universal coverage, investments in preparation for 5G etc. (it may entail various entities ranging from policymakers, the emerging infrastructure industry, vendors, some telecom and tech companies, non-TMT companies and other entities etc.); (3) non-TMT business interests; and (4) the tech industry.   The key dilemma in digital connectivity transformation in our view lays in the debate on where is it best to standardize and regulate, possibly with a heavy hand, and which markets should be left as free from regulation as possible. In theory, dividing lines between the former and the latter should be driven by (1) innovation (regulating of innovative businesses slows progress); (2) externalities (if duplication causes negative externalities and brings no economic value, there may be a case for regulation-enforced sharing); and (3) national interests (regulated, standardized, and secure infrastructure may in some cases fit with national interest). Irrespective on how the above dilemma is tackled, regulatory clarity and predictability is always helpful for investors. As the digitalization of national economies continues progressing, pressures from various stakeholders to build a robust, universal, secure, and efficiently utilized connectivity infrastructure, particularly in fiber, is likely to continue rising. Utility Model in Telecom Infrastructure Including FiberTelecoms are a somewhat unusual industry. As we learned at a CIO event in Oxford last month, infrastructure industries such as airports and utilities often appreciate regulation, because it boosts entry barriers and protects them from potentially disruptive competition. A number of service industries such as banks and taxi services may benefit from regulation in a similar way. Even Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, recently said that the tech industry would benefit from some regulation.",494
46,"Instead, telecoms are largely known for their opposition to practically any heavy regulation of their business. The very idea that some telecom infrastructure could be better run as a structurally separated regulated utility is quite controversial and polarizing within the telecom industry. It is perhaps slightly ironical that the Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman of the world’s leading telecom association, GSMA, outlined his vision of the (structurally separated) Network Company/ Services Company (NetCo/ServCo) model at the Mobile World Congress this year.We are well aware of theoretical and practical complexities of the NetCo/ServCo model. The former includes the exact choice of assets to be separated and effectively outsourced (Mr. Mittal spoke about undersea cables, towers, and fiber), but also questions about the future of the ServCo. The latter involves major corporate restructuring of often complex businesses and consolidation of competitive infrastructure markets with possibly diverse technologies. We learned at Oxford that majority of large business transformation projects in the U.K. tend to fail, partially because stakeholders do not sufficiently believe in them. This could be a major problem in telecoms as well, and indeed a reason why still a large number of investors are vocally opposed to structural separation. Similarly to Mr. Mittal, we do however see utility-like infrastructure as a natural evolution in telecom infrastructure, at least in some areas. Moves towards such model can benefit the established telecoms in the following ways: The regulated infrastructure utility model could reduce the risk of future technological and regulatory disruption (such as the one currently faced by copper networks). A national fiber network may be seen as strategic infrastructure, possibly even linked to other national utilities etc. Such a solution would for example reduce the need for some of the currently applied regulations such as opening of passive infrastructure.   If major fiber investment becomes a must as opposed to a choice, telecoms may need long-term investors such as infrastructure and pension funds, to fund network expansion. These investors appreciate the protection as well as the predictability of the utility-based model, in which pricing and returns could be determined for example by the RAB (Regulatory Asset Based) model.   Structural separation can force a major review and ‘cleaning-up’ of inefficiencies in the underlying incumbent businesses. This effect was crucial in success of the Czech case three years ago, when the ServCo share price appreciated more than five times in the few months post separation.",486
47,"  By supporting the concept of shared utility infrastructure, some telecoms could resolve major conceptual conflicts with their regulators and instead focus on shaping future regulations in their favor (this is currently driving Elliott Adviser’s efforts at Telecom Italia; if the mentioned EU agreement to promote the wholesale-only model becomes EU law, this issue may gain more relevance across Europe).   Finally, in the longer term, 5G is likely to bring new opportunities in shared fiber infrastructure for connecting a dense network of smaller cells. Fiber infrastructure duplication for 5G may not be economical. Utility-like fiber infrastructure companies would be in best position to benefit from such opportunities. DIGITECCS – Turning Telecom Strategic Optionality Discount into a PremiumCan telecoms turn their Strategic Optionality Discount into a premium? Telecoms, which want to achieve this, in our view need to: (1) become open minded about the future of their infrastructure assets, particularly passive and capital-intensive ones. Although this does not mean instantly turning all such assets into separate utility-like companies, it does mean taking a longer-term view about shareholder interests and the future role of networks in a digitalized economy; (2) show greater strategic flexibility in pursuing opportunities in the most attractive growth areas such as software, platforms, content, big data, and over the longer-term also smart networks for industrial internet (IoT); and (3) present a convincing plan about execution of their transformational strategies. This involves creation of the right structure to support innovation. Equally, this may involve scaling down the legacy telecom businesses, which are no longer needed due to digital innovation.3Most importantly, successful DIGITECCS transformation requires strong conviction and belief in the process and its objectives not only by the telecom companies, but ideally also by policymakers, investors, customers, and other stakeholders. Such an economically- and strategically-backed belief would in our view allow telecom companies to achieve more supportive stance from policymakers and other partners. This would in turn justify taking the necessary risks towards dismantling and voluntarily disrupting legacy businesses, structures, management incentives etc. and replacing them with ones more suitable for digital economy.",424
48,"We think a risk-taking, radical approach and long-term strategic perspective are necessary for conducting such a transformation in a shareholder value accretive way due to a need to beat the industry’s inherent inertia.To further justify the DIGITECCS transformation we also draw attention to new opportunities for telecoms arising from: (1) regulation of big tech; (2) changes to big tech business models (including for example Microsoft’s recent push into Cloud and move to sell its products as services, which led to broadening of its partnerships also with telecoms); (3) data and cybersecurity (telecoms can aim to become trusted national software-driven digital service providers); (4) industrial Internet (IoT, 5G) driven future demand for bespoke connectivity with quality guarantees to be delivered via smart networks; (5) national data sovereignty regulations; and (6) environmentally and socially responsible investing (limiting unnecessary network duplications and focusing on building employment in progressive areas).Many telecoms are already experimenting in the software and digital service layers, although most of them on a relatively small scale. Corporate venture capital investments,i.e. tech investments via newly established separate vehicles, have been favored by some, for example by Orange and the Saudi Telecom Company. To materially boost their Strategic Option Value telcos in our view need to overcome fear from making their underlying business less dependent on basic network infrastructure and take enough risk in the service business to warrant a meaningful return. Taking such risks may be justified by synergies with infrastructure assets retained in the service company (e.g. active components, spectrum) along with opportunities discussed in the previous paragraph.To make other stakeholders believe in DIGITECCS-inspired strategies, telecom executives in our view need to clearly distance themselves from the legacy business models. Similar to the tobacco industry, telecoms need to accept some short- term pain linked to speeding up the transition from a challenged legacy business to their new business model. Many telecom managers find it challenging to take such a clear position, also due to a wide range of conflicting interests.One operator, whose transformation stood out last year, is Turkcell. Its management, which has relatively limited legacy telecom experience, fully and clearly outlined the company’s aspiration towards an asset-light and software platform-driven strategy, mirroring our DIGITECCS concept. Turckell was the world’s best performing telecom stock last year (out of MSCI included stocks), based on local currency return including dividends.",489
49,"Its re-rating was driven by both an improvement in near-term financial outlook, i.e. Financial Outlook Based Value, but also a valuation multiple re-rating reflective of boosted Strategic Optionality Value.DIGITECCS – A Win-Win Outcome for Telecoms and PolicymakersSuccessful TMT companies are prone to building scale economies and also influence. Hence regulation will always matter. The route to success in our view entails the creation of win-win situations, where the companies’ and policymakers’ interests become aligned. Policymakers usually focus on economic growth, infrastructure investments, competitiveness in innovative industries, national security, employment, and the environment. The Silicon Valley success story is an example of such alignment, when an innovative industry drives growth, and indirectly also drives infrastructure investments, national innovative competitiveness and high skilled employment. Telecoms with DIGITECCS strategies may in our view face similar opportunities. Shared utility-based infrastructure can attract cheaper and longer-term funding. Meanwhile the ServCo businesses focused on software and technology differentiation would help boosting the innovative competitiveness of countries and play a central role in the future of industrial internet (IoT/5G), both from smart connectivity as well as a security point of view.",239

Asia as a Time Machine to the FutureOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle25 May 2023Asia as a Time Machine to the FutureSeven Areas Where Asia Gives Interesting Insights Into the FutureCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsShareDownload Report Executive SummaryWe estimate Asia adopts new technologies 8-12 years ahead of the West, making it much like a time machine to the future. While its infrastructure has historically been underdeveloped relative to the West’s, Asia’s high internet connectivity, young and increasingly affluent and urban demographics, and entrepreneurial spirit have driven the region to adopt many technologies at a faster pace. In doing so, Asia provides a glimpse of what the future could look like in more developed, Western economies. The key drivers behind Asia's faster adoption of technology include underdeveloped infrastructure, especially in retail, banking, and healthcare, as well as high internet penetration, young digital natives, urbanization, a rising middle class, and an entrepreneurial spirit.  Key areas where Asia currently holds an advantage over the West include: Super apps — mobile apps that integrate multiple functions under a single umbrella — are unique to Asia, yet they are ubiquitous across the region. Driven by younger demographics and high digital adoption, Asian users are immersed in super apps and enjoy the convenience, ease of use, and multitude of services they provide.  Asia leads the rest of the world in adopting mobile payments both online and offline. According to FIS, in 2021, digital/mobile wallets accounted for nearly 70% of the e-commerce transaction value in Asia, more than double that of North America or Europe. Likewise, for purchases at physical points-of-sale, nearly half, or 44%, of transactions in Asia were done via digital/mobile wallets, a share 4-5x larger than in the West.  Social commerce is a subset of e-commerce that offers consumers an integrated platform with social features, providing more immersive and interactive shopping experience. Asia was the first region to introduce several social commerce formats, such as livestreaming e-commerce. According to Insider Intelligence, the U.S. is expected to reach China's 2018 level of social commerce penetration in 2026, indicating that China is roughly eight years ahead in social commerce. Short-form videos have revolutionized the way people consume and creators develop video content.",487
51,"The commercialization of short-term videos took off in China, most notably through TikTok. Taking note of this video format's success, Western tech giants have been racing to create their own products with similar features, as the competition for users and advertising budgets intensifies.  While South Korea is widely regarded as the ""home of eSports,"" the eSports boom quickly spread to other Asian countries, making the region central to the world of competitive gaming. Over the past decade, countries in the West have followed in Asia's footsteps by professionalizing eSports, organizing eSports tournaments, devleloping successful eSports teams, attracting sponsorships, and supporting a growing livestreaming market. Meanwhile, Asia continues to explore new frontiers in eSports: refining the eSports value chain, popularizing and scaling the mobile eSports ecosystem, and creating eSports hubs. Webtoons — digital comics optimized for viewing on mobile devices — originated in Asia, where the industry continues to dominate, and are now making inroads into Western markets. South Korean companies have launched local-language versions of existing webtoons, venturing outside of Asian markets. They have also acquired local Western players, exporting their respective original webtoon content via acquired platforms. Like anime, manga, and K-pop, webtoons are softly permeating into Western media and entertainment. In Asia, digital healthcare is significant in terms of both scale and penetration. Digital healthcare is reported to have touched the lives of around 1.5 billion people in Asia (in terms of registered users across emerging healthcare platforms), and its user base is continuing to grow. Furthermore, studies suggest the adoption rate of digital healthcare in developing Asia is 2.5 times the rate in the U.S. Moreover, unlike the West, where various scaled players specialize in each vertical of healthcare services, the digital healthcare industry in Asia has evolved from a standalone play to a comprehensive ecosystem of services.  TechnologyInnovationUP NEXTArticleDisruptive Innovations IXCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleMetaverse and MoneyCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleChina's Inward Turn Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",477

That’s how fast FinTech and disruption can come at you.In our first Citi GPS report on FinTech, Digital Disruption: How FinTech is Forcing Banking to a Tipping Point, we compared the amount of investment in FinTech and the uptake of product in China and the West. We found that Internet giants had moved into financial services and gained considerable market share in e-commerce and third-party payments in China, while only 1% of North American consumer banking revenues had migrated to new digital models. China was found to be past the tipping point with FinTech companies having a similar number of clients as major banks but North America and Europe were just coming up to the tipping point with rising revenue impact from digital disruption.One year later, in our second report Digital Disruption Revisited: What FinTech VC Investments Tell Us About a Changing Industry, we took a harder look at China and the huge influx of global FinTech Venture Capital investments that were feeding the Chinese FinTech dragons and analyzed how these dragons were able to rise under unique circumstances. We did notice at the time that FinTech investments in the U.S., although slow vs. China, were seeing a shift away from lending and towards InsurTech, RegTech, and Blockchain.Fast forward one more year, and the question for banks today is how do they become Digital Banking Superstars versus going the way of the dinosaurs. The future of finance is an ever increasingly converged ecosystem where consumer and small and medium enterprise (SME) financial services are provided by banks and by platform companies with roots in e-commerce and social media.",458

Has it embraced the digital age like other services you deal with daily? A substantial number of new entrants into the banking sector think that answer is no and that they can provide a new banking model using technology and digital channels to deliver a better digital customer experience.During the Great Financial Crisis, legacy banks turned their focus to cost and capital optimization to help drive profitability amid a backdrop of slowing revenue growth. New regulations and changing business practices meant that technology investment was diverted towards regulatory and compliance challenges. While this was happening, smaller ‘challenger banks’ began to emerge driven by FinTech startups. These challenger banks were designed around the digital revolution and were able to leverage data insights via agile technology stacks. With these insights, they offered a customer personalization in their financial services and a fully digital banking experience.As noted in the report that follows, legacy banks often have data that is stuck in multiple silos supported by core banking technology that was literally built in the age of black and white television. Manual intervention is high, which slows down operating speed, reduces flexibility, increases costs, and ultimately degrades efficiency and experience.",290
54,"Because a lot of digital technology isn’t part of core banking technology, challenger banks tend to be quicker at incorporating new products and processes onto their platforms and help to easily connect with third-party products — offering more choices to the end user.Three types of challenger banks have emerged: (1) standalone challenger banks, which are primarily FinTech companies leveraging technology and data to streamline retail banking by offering better convenience and pricing; (2) incumbent-led challenger banks, which are started within legacy banks through investment in technology and by creating new digital-only banks; and (3) BigTech-led challenger banks, which are created through GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) and BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) and who can use their vast networks to acquire customers quickly as they branch out into financial services.The challenge for incumbent banks is that while digitalization can lower costs by 30-50% (primarily through a decline in full-time employees as technology disintermediates workers), new competition and greater transparency are likely to lower revenues by 10-30%. We expect the digital disruption risk to start in payments and then widen to other financial products. The tipping point for incumbent banks is if their core businesses of savings and loans are impacted.Creating an ‘incumbent challenger’ sounds like an oxymoron, but as legacy banks recognize the threat that new entrants into banking are posing to revenue and customers, they need to reinvent themselves and reimagine banking.",299

Beyond China- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle16 Mar 2015Beyond ChinaThe Future of the Global Natural Resources EconomyCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadCiti was one of the first to call the death of the Commodities Supercycle, but while most now accept that the “Long Boom” has ended, there has been limited effort devoted to mapping what comes next. This report presents Citi’s view of the next decade for commodity markets and repercussions for natural resource economies.The structure of global economic growth is once again undergoing a fundamental transition, shifting away from the prevailing model of China as the world’s factory and advanced economies as the drivers of consumer demand. In its place, a more heterogeneous, multipolar framework is emerging with both manufacturing and final consumption more broadly spread across the globe.Whereas the Commodities Supercycle was characterized by rapid, synchronized global demand growth centered on the rise of China, we expect the coming decade to feature slower, more geographically diverse, less synchronized demand growth. The drivers of natural resources demand are spreading across the globe in new ways. For oil, demand growth should increasingly come from the Middle East. For coal, the same is true of India. Only in base metals does China’s predominance look to remain unchallenged. As a result, the traditional practice of analyzing commodities demand based on the U.S., China and Europe will become less relevant as the drivers of incremental demand come increasingly from the “Emerging 5”: India, ASEAN, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.However, no large emerging market is likely to rise up to the point where China has now come to a landing. The most cited potential successors, India and Brazil, are based on democratic institutions unlikely to provide the consensus required to sustain high fixed asset investment levels. Japan and Europe could do this from the 1950s through the 1970s due to the imperative of post-WWII reconstruction. The “Asian tigers” also succeeded, but under what were initially authoritarian systems.Moreover, growth in the “Emerging 5” is unlikely to prevent structurally slower commodities demand growth. This is due partly to slowing global population growth, partly to China’s slowdown, and partly to elevated base effects following China’s rise.",484
56,"Technological innovation also plays a role, particularly for energy.Trade flows are expected to slow as China’s demand growth decelerates and as natural resource exporters focus on developing domestic downstream industries. At the same time, the U.S. energy revolution is transforming the world’s largest energy importer into an exporter, even if lower prices slow production growth. Commodities flows are thus redirecting away from the U.S. and Europe, growing less rapidly to China, and instead focusing on the “Emerging 5”.Economies highly dependent on natural resource exports (which were among the fastest growing during the Commodities Supercycle) now face structural economic, social and political challenges. In response, these countries are likely to invest in downstream manufacturing sectors, resulting in more diversified domestic economic profiles and more diversified global commodities demand.While the highly cyclical character of natural resources supply is unlikely to change, reduced reliance on the U.S.",185

If they’re working and able to pay their bills then the economy is doing okay. If they’re able to get an extra vacation in during the year and plan to take the kids to a theme park or have saved up enough money to buy a new car, then the economy is doing better than okay. And when bad times hit and jobs become scarce, paychecks become stretched, and rainy day funds are dipped into to cover basic expenses, the economy is bad.Without identifying it by name, the average person actually has a good understanding of the economic cycle — peaks and troughs, expansions and contractions. Since the 1980s, an added piece to the economic narrative was that globalization would help drive the economy and make the transition between economic ups and downs a bit smoother as global corporations would have a bigger marketplace for their goods and services. Consumers would benefit from a larger variety of imported goods at their local stores and, as corporates set up global value chains, they would also benefit from lower prices on the goods they purchased. In the end, the selling point was the world would be a wealthier place as the rising tide of globalization would lift all boats.However, not everyone believes globalization actually delivered on its promise. Manufacturing companies in advanced economies were able to create global supply chains utilizing lower cost workers in different parts of the world. And yes, those products came back to the consumer at a lower price, but that didn’t matter if you were the one who lost your job when the factory moved overseas.",403

This will pave the way for him to extend his term beyond 2022 and put more weight on the economic policies and priorities that he advocates.Given that the ‘China dependence’ of many countries has risen considerably as China has become the largest contributor to global growth (at 40% vs. the U.S. at 16% in 2016), it is important to take a deeper look into the economic policies and initiatives unveiled at the Party Congress. In the report that follows, we outline what was said, examine the implications for Chinese growth based on the policies announced, and also examine the effect of these policies on the rest of the world. Although specific GDP growth targets weren’t mentioned at the Party Congress, the Communist Party of China has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to doubling China’s 2010 GDP and per capita income by 2020, which we estimate would require annual growth of at least 6.3%, which we view as feasible. Economic stability and risk control will continue to be a high priority for China to avoid a hard-landing scenario and maintain a minimum level of acceptable growth no matter the rhetoric.

China's Inward Turn OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle11 Oct 2022China's Inward Turn The Pursuit of Economic Self-RelianceCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsShareDownloadIt is said that “change is the only constant in life.” This sentiment took on particular significance over the past few years as the COVID-19 pandemic raced around the globe. Whether it was personal shifts in how people worked and interacted or larger geopolitical shifts, change seemed to be all around us. As the pandemic increasingly becomes a thing of the past, there is a desire for things to go back to the way they were — get back to the office, start traveling again, and gather in large groups for holidays and events. But can the world really go back to the way it was? In our December 2021 Citi GPS report on Global Supply Chains, we noted the pandemic forced corporates and governments to quickly adjust their supply chains to deal with border closings, lockdowns that kept production sites shuttered, and sudden shifts in demand as consumers spent more on merchandise than services. The lessons learned from the experience resulted in a shift from “just-in-time” to “just-in-case” inventory and a reassessment of global supply chains in general. Governments responded by categorizing certain industries as critical and vowing to produce certain goods domestically in the name of essential security.In this new report, we look specifically at China and how change in the past few years, and before then as a result of the Great Financial Crisis, has resulted in a shift in the country’s development path in pursuit of self-reliance. China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, released in 2020, announced a policy framework of “dual circulation” economics whereby China is rebalancing from an export-led “international circulation” strategy to one that focuses more on its domestic market through self-reliance, or “domestic circulation.” This transition towards a more inward-looking growth model was given additional urgency in response to recent geopolitical events, in particular the U.S.-China trade war and tightening export controls on U.S.",442
61,"technology, and the sanctions imposed on Russia after the Ukraine invasion.The report focuses on three areas in which China’s pursuit of self-reliance seems especially clear: (1) technology and self-sufficiency in semiconductor development; (2) agriculture, where China can nearly secure its supply of staple grains but relies on imports of feed grains; and (3) energy, where dependence on natural gas imports has increased as part of a decarbonization push.In order to address the challenges brought by China’s inward tilt, the government elevated innovation to “core status” in its modernization. Technology decoupling amid U.S. protectionism has pushed China to focus its innovation strategy on self-reliance in technology upgrading, which may ultimately lead to China’s Sputnik moment in innovation. Strong government spending on research and development, a large domestic market, and highly-skilled talent position China to increasingly compete with industrialized economies and a more normalized regulatory regime for platform companies should help minimize the risk of innovation being stymied.Although self-reliance is the focus of the report, positive international spillovers will continue as China’s import demand for food and consumers goods remains strong. In addition, other economies can benefit as labor-intensive manufacturing increasingly finds locations other than China.Despite its inward turn to address the challenges of today’s new world, China’s global relevance will continue to only grow.Authors: Johanna Chua,Yuanliu Hu,Xinyu Ji,Xiaowen Jin, CFA,Jin-Wook Kim,David Lubin,Xiangrong Yu,UP NEXTArticleFor Better or Worse, Has Globalization Peaked?Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleChina’s Belt & Road at FiveCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleChina in TransitionCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",417

China's Belt and Road Initiative- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle10 Dec 2018China’s Belt & Road at FiveA Progress ReportCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadChina’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) marked its fifth birthday in September 2018, though there was probably less to celebrate than the Chinese authorities might have wished. Five years after President Xi presented the initiative to the world in a speech in Kazakhstan, the BRI is facing pressures on three fronts. The first is what might be called a ‘dollar constraint’. Since the renminbi is not a fully functioning global currency, the BRI largely requires dollar-denominated financial resources to fulfill its objectives: it is significant that the major financing announcements made to kick-start the BRI in 2014 — recapitalizations of the China Development Bank, China Export-Import Bank, as well as new capital for Silk Road Fund, the AIIB, and the New Development Bank — were all made in dollars. And since China lacks an infinite supply of dollars, it therefore lacks an infinite capacity to meet its goals.The second is the increasingly loud accusation from recipient countries that the initiative is too little ‘win-win’ and too much ‘China-win’. This summer the Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad described a “new colonialism” — a phrase that captures the idea that the BRI has led to the accumulation of liabilities on receiving countries’ balance sheets to pay for projects of uncertain value, built mostly by Chinese contractors on opaque terms, allowing China’s regional influence to grow in ways that are out of proportion to the benefits that countries can expect to enjoy. This kind of concern led to Malaysia’s suspension last month of the $20 billion East Coast Rail Link, one of the biggest-ticket projects in the entire BRI. Even Pakistan, whose people and governments routinely express the world’s most amiable view of China, recently cut down the scale and cost of the Karachi-Peshawar railroad project. The IMF’s Managing Director has called for ‘absolute transparency’ in the nature of the liabilities the BRI is creating.A third source of unease now facing the BRI is the explicit opposition of the United States, made clear in recent speeches by the U.S.",482
65,"Vice President, who has warned recipient countries against what he described as a ‘constricting belt’ and a ‘one-way road’. What started off as an unwelcoming but tolerant U.S. response to the BRI five years ago has now turned into outright hostility.The BRI should be understood as in the context of a shift in Chinese foreign policy that has become evident in the past few years. The Deng-era concept of tao guang yang hui — ‘hide your light and make the most of your obscurity’ — was replaced in late 2013, shortly after Xi’s Kazakhstan speech, with a more assertive principle: fen fa you wei, or ‘exert yourself and get things done’. The BRI can be seen as an extension of this principle into the economic sphere. As with any new foreign policy strategy, a period of reassessment will follow the initial implementation. In broad terms, Chinese scholars are already debating whether China has been guilty of ‘strategic overstretch’ in recent years. Given some of the constraints that the BRI has faced since its launch, the question can similarly be posed about the initiative itself.Perhaps what will emerge from this debate is a ‘kinder, gentler’ BRI, one that is more sensitive to the international criticisms described above, and one that more obviously meets China’s objective of becoming a ‘many-to-many’ platform for international cooperation that links countries through the development of infrastructure, trade agreements, a simplification of customs procedures, and cultural exchange. One indication that this might be the case lies in China’s growing interest in co-financing BRI projects with multilateral developments banks. Since these banks require open tendering and adherence to strict governance standards, their involvement could create a more multilateral-looking BRI.Though it might change shape, the BRI is certainly not going away.",376

If undertaken correctly, the multiplier effect of the capital deployed toward many of these measures can also provide a useful spur to growth.Matching Capital with Opportunity Is EssentialTens of trillions of dollar are looking to invest with positive impact, but capital is not getting to where it is needed the most because of a mismatch in risk appetite of the capital. Sustainability-linked bonds could offer an attractive solution for the providers of capital, as well as those seeking access to it.Subscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",448

Climate Finance OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesArticle04 Nov 2022Climate Finance Mobilizing the Public and Private Sector to Ensure a Just Energy TransitionCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadAt the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November 2021, world leaders came together and set a global agenda on a path to net zero emissions. Pledges were made to further cut carbon dioxide emissions, reduce the use of coal, lower methane emissions, and stop deforestation. Importantly, an actionable framework was put around the promises made in the Paris Agreement. There are volumes of literature explaining why the world needs to focus on lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Countless experts list the devastating effects rising global temperatures will have on weather, crops, biodiversity, migration, and health. And a continuous stream of politicians and public figures tell us how important it is to support a green agenda. But unfortunately, there has been little focus on what is likely the most important subject — how do we pay for global action on climate change?In the report that follows, we aim to answer two questions: (1) What investment is needed in different regions and countries for climate mitigation and adaptation? and (2) How can we mobilize this investment efficiently to enable the world to reach its climate goals while still growing in population and developing the economy?Overall, it is estimated that $125 trillion will be needed for the world to reach net zero by 2050. From 2021-25, that equates to $2.6 trillion per year, rising to $3.8 trillion from 2026 through 2030. Although climate finance has increased over the past decade, it is still significantly below the levels required for us to be on the path to net zero. Average annual climate finance flows in 2016-20 were estimated at between $600 billion and $900 billion meaning there is a $1.7 trillion gap between what the world has been delivering each year towards climate financing and what is required through 2025. Alarmingly, no single country or region is currently on track to meet its individual climate financing targets.Mobilizing climate financing is a challenge as there is no one global solution. The public sector, including governments and development finance institutions, has played an extremely important role in mobilizing finance and the private sector has contributed 49% of investment funds.",500
68,"Unlocking private sector capital for climate finance is crucial as private actors could provide 70% of the $2.6 trillion needed in investment every year (on average in 2021-25) to put the world on a path to net zero by 2050.[1]Financial instruments, such as blended finance, in conjunction with development finance institutions can increase private sector investment in developing economies. And green banks, which develop clean project pipelines, are using innovative financing to accelerate the transition to clean energy.Collaboration — between developed and developing economies as well as the public and private sectors — is key to making this a just transition.[1] UNFCCC Race to Zero campaign with support and analysis from Vivid Economics, “Financing Road Maps,” accessed November 2, 2022.Authors: Elizabeth Curmi,Jason Channell,Ying Qin,Amy Thompson,Climate Finance GapClimate-related projects mobilized between $600 billion and $900 billion on average annually in 2016-20. The IEA Net Zero Scenario estimates $125 trillion is required to reach net zero over the next 30 years. Therefore, getting on a path to net zero requires an additional annual investment of $1.7 trillion in 2021-25 in mitigation alone. Developing countries especially need support as they do not have the fiscal capacity to invest in climate action.Substantial Investment Scale Is Needed Across All RegionsCurrent climate investment flows need to be scaled up substantially as no region is currently on track to deliver enough investment to meet their climate finance needs. For example, investments need to reach $170 billion in Africa, $1.1 trillion in Asia Pacific, and $500 billion in North America annually between 2021 and 2025 in order to build low-carbon economies and adapt to climate change, with even higher needs in 2026-30. In all three regions, current investment flows are substantially below what is needed.Making It HappenMobilizing climate finance is challenging, but we need to start looking at climate action as an opportunity versus a cost. Making this happen will require mobilizing the private and public sectors to work together, to create projects that are bankable, and to ensure a just transition.",450
69,"global insights citigps coming pensions crisis. The Coming Pension Crisis- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountVideo15 Mar 2016The Coming Pensions CrisisRecommendations for Keeping the Global Pensions System AfloatCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadWhat's your dream for retirement? Is it living on the beach, traveling on cruise ships throughout Europe, spending time with kids and grandkids, finally getting the chance to perfect your golf game? For a lot of people, the retirement dream is to retire early enough so that they can enjoy the fruits of their long working career while they're still healthy and to live out their sunset years relaxing and enjoying the good life. However, the reality for many is that there isn't enough money in the piggy bank to last throughout their retired life.Workers in the past trusted that the defined benefit pension plans provided by their employers would keep them and their spouse living comfortably through their retirement. And if anything happened with their corporate pensions, they figured they had paid into government social security and it would be more than enough to cover things. Today's workers are a bit less worry-free. With the rise of defined contribution plans, employees are being asked to manage their own retirement account which puts the onus on them to ensure they not only put enough away money for retirement, but also invest that money properly to get the best return. Improvements in healthcare are increasing life expectancies meaning retirement money needs to last much longer. At the same time demographic shifts — an increase in the retirement age population accompanied by a decrease in the working age population — are starting to put a strain on pay-as-you-go government schemes such as social security.How much of a problem is it? According to our estimates, the total value of unfunded or underfunded government pension liabilities for twenty OECD countries is a staggering $78 trillion, or almost double the $44 trillion published national debt number. Corporations have also not consistently met their pension obligation and most U.S. and U.K. corporate pension plans remain underfunded with an aggregate fund status in the US of just 82%.In the report that follows, the authors look at the scope of the pension problem both on the public and the private side. But instead of being all doom and gloom, they offer a set of recommendations to policymakers, corporate and public pension plan sponsors and managers, and product providers to deal with the crisis.",500
70,"These include: (1) publishing the amount of underfunded government pension obligations so that everyone can see them, (2) raising the retirement age, (3) creating a new system that utilizes Collective Defined Contribution plans which share both the risks and benefits of the plan between plan sponsors and individuals, (4) creating powerful 'soft compulsion' incentives to ensure that private pension savings increase, (5) encouraging pension plan sponsors to make their full pension contributions when they are due, and (6) encouraging corporates with frozen plans to get out of the insurance business.Finally, the silver lining of the pensions crisis is for product providers such as insurers and asset managers. Private pension assets are forecast to grow $5-$11 trillion over the next 10-30 years and strong growth is forecast in insurance pension buy-outs, private pension schemes, and asset and guaranteed retirement income solutions.With hope that we can still avoid a pension crisis, I’m not giving up on my Hawaiian shirt just yet.Authors: Farooq Hanif,Charles Millard,Erik J Bass, CFA,Elizabeth Curmi,Darwin Lam, CFA,Nigel Pittaway,Authors: Farooq Hanif,Charles Millard,Erik J Bass, CFA,Elizabeth Curmi,Darwin Lam, CFA,Nigel Pittaway,Authors: Farooq Hanif,Charles Millard,Erik J Bass, CFA,Elizabeth Curmi, PhD.,Darwin Lam, CFA,Nigel Pittaway,Click here to view the report in full.DebtPensionsUP NEXTArticleDebt Problem UnsolvedCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleThe Strategic Benefits of Funding Pensions TodayCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleWhy Labor Market Reforms Won’t Solve the Euro Area Jobs CrisisCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",422
71,"global insights citigps current telecom infrastructure. Is the Current Telecom Regulation Helping Economic Growth? - Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle27 Feb 2015Is the Current Telecom Regulation Helping Economic Growth?Citi GPS Opinion ArticleCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsContributor(s):  Dalibor Vavruska(Global Head of Digital Connectivity Strategy & Head of CEEMEA Telecom Research)ShareImagine the owner of a motorway who was keen to dominate the haulage business. He may think that advanced knowledge of motorway maintenance closures could give his transportation arm a competitive advantage. Such a synergy-driven combination of infrastructure and service businesses may be beneficial for the infrastructure owner, but it may harm competition in the service business (in this instance haulage), potentially resulting in higher prices and less service differentiation. Luckily, road owners have stayed away from the transportation business, allowing full and fair competition among transportation companies, which all use the same roads. In a similar way, airport owners usually stay away from operating airlines and electricity and water companies do not aim to dominate markets for electricity and water appliances. Interestingly, even PC and smartphone manufacturers experienced a major boom after their hardware and operating systems were separated.That said the concept of infrastructure and service separation is not prevalent in all industries. Many national railway infrastructure owners still monopolize national train services. National telecom operators held similar monopolies for nearly 100 years, keeping full control not only over their network and the services provided on them, but also over the equipment their customers used. Technological progress such as the arrival of fax machines made such control untenable and telecom monopolies were initially forced to open up their networks to a wider range of equipment. The US authorities subsequently broke up the AT&T monopoly, which together with increased infrastructure competition using new technologies (such as cable TV and wireless) and interconnect regulation, paved the way for telecom liberalization around the world.In contrast to the past century, today's consumers enjoy a wide range of alternatives when it comes to communications services. Many consumers, particularly those in the developed world, have multiple Internet connection options — fixed-line (DSL), cable TV, wireless and in some areas also fiber technologies — and the Internet itself provides them with vast amounts of free or cheap information (content). In line with the principle of net neutrality, telecom operators have very limited power to filter or prioritize Internet content for their own commercial benefit.",494
72,"As a result, the Internet has managed to empower individuals against various legacy businesses or even authorities by offering cheap and easy access to content as well as the ability to create and share content, make more knowledgeable purchasing decisions and even find new forms of entertainment. Given all this, there is little doubt about why Internet penetration has skyrocketed globally. Contrary to popular belief, this growth has not been driven just by technology, but crucially also by two fundamental consumer-biased policy concepts: telecom liberalization and net neutrality.World leaders starting to re-evaluate telecom and Internet regulationThe rapid rise of the Internet is however creating challenges. Growing unease of the world's population about the speed of technological change was one of the key themes at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos. Issues of concern range from the loss of privacy, threats to security and the psychological consequences of excessive exposure to the virtual world (e.g. loss of real human relationships) to the impact of the Internet on regional economies. Debates about key regulatory dilemmas such as net neutrality are increasingly attracting the attention of world leaders. Meanwhile, differences in views on this subject between the US President Barack Obama and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel were made clear towards the end of 2014 when both leaders specifically commented on the subject. As also reflected in the latest FCC decision, the US stance is increasingly pro-neutrality, which means regulating Internet service provision as a public utility. In Europe, Angela Merkel has argued against net neutrality and called for a two-lane Internet — one for special, high priority service and another that’s meant to resemble the Internet as it exists today. The European stance is reflected in the European Digital Agenda, which aims to structure digital industries to promote across-the-board economic growth.It is currently hard to say whether and when the EU may succeed in implementing a fundamental overhaul of its telecom and Internet regulation by applying the following measures: (a) wider opening of communications networks and Internet of Things opportunities to local industries; (b) attracting more long-term capital into telecom infrastructure; (c) attracting investments into telecoms by allowing better monetization of the true economic value of telecom infrastructure; (d) forcing efficiency and scale effects on the existing telecom industry; and (e) some rebalancing of power from the global Internet and tech giants towards local industries including telecommunications.The EU political leadership in our view currently has the incentive, the right conditions, as well as the determination to overhaul telecom regulation.",496
73,"There are also some good examples globally of pro-growth regulatory initiatives in Israel, Australia and the UK. Based on recent financial investor meetings on this subject we have confirmed that investors are starting to take the possibility of a progressive reform in the pan-European telecom regulation more seriously. Although the European Digital Agenda should conceptually make a positive difference for Europe's global competitive positioning, it continues to face challenges in two main areas. Firstly, similarly to the pan-European integration process as a whole, it faces a lack of willingness by national governments to escalate powers to the EU, especially when revenue collection is involved. Secondly, there is relatively material political opposition in the European Parliament against compromising net neutrality as a principle.Cracks in the basis of telecom and Internet business modelWe see two fundamental flaws in the current policies around the telecom and Internet companies. Ironically, they are both closely linked to the major concepts, which have helped to create the Internet as we know it today.1. Telecom liberalization reforms of the past three decades have conceptual flaws and they have failed to establish a sustainable model for telecoms and the Internet; this may eventually impact global economic growth.Unlike in motorways, airports, electricity or water utilities, telecom infrastructure owners often attempt to monopolize or at least lead the market for services offered on their infrastructure. Similarly to the motorway example, such a model may harm service competition in telecoms and hence adversely impact the economy. Telecom operators often justify the lack of service competition using a concept called infrastructure competition, i.e. the existence of parallel networks able to deliver comparable service, which according to the operators, assures competitive pricing and service differentiation. However, the infrastructure competition concept in telecoms in its basic form has severe flaws, both practical and conceptual, as also pointed out by last year's Nobel Prize laureate Jean Tirole.In cases where multiple competitors have equal resources such as spectrum, technology and access to sites, infrastructure competition tends to produce unstable outcomes. The key differentiating factors in these cases become price and investment. Unless the market evolves into an oligopoly, scale economies encourage all players to stay competitive at all times and essentially match their rivals' moves. This easily leads to price and capital expenditure wars which are hard to overcome without a cut in the number of competitors or arbitrary regulatory interference. Many mobile markets — including the European ones — have demonstrated this.A different situation arises when one competitor has an infrastructure advantage such as better spectrum, technology or site access.",493
74,"This situation could theoretically produce a stable outcome when the superior network — such as cable TV vs. legacy DSL fixed-line— attracts pricing premium. In practice, however, scale economies encourage the superior resource owners to price competitively and dramatically reduce the inferior resource owners' market share and profits. Customers are usually reluctant to choose an operator, whose service quality is clearly inferior versus the mainstream, even when it comes at a material discount. This explains why it is sometimes hard to competitively challenge infrastructure-dominating incumbents. This concept is easily seen in the US fixed-line broadband access market, which was designed purely based on infrastructure competition. Following the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC's) recent reclassification of high speed broadband (to over 25 Mbps) more than half of US families do not have a choice for their fixed-line broadband provider. In the road analogy, they would only be able to use the motorway when also using vehicles provided by the motorway owner. Their only alternative is to use slow roads.In summary, telecom liberalization reforms of the past three decades may have been driven not only by excessive focus on the consumer as opposed to business-to-business (B2B), but also by excessive expectations from infrastructure competition and often insufficient conceptual appreciation of service competition. In our view, such an imbalance may have affected the current efficiency of the telecom industry, which itself plays an increasingly important role as the backbone of global economies. However, Market forces and natural processes are already rectifying this. Since 2012, when global wireless revenue slowed to low single digit levels we have seen wireless in-market infrastructure consolidation around the world, starting with towers and expanding into networks and entire mobile businesses. Meanwhile, we have also seen rise of new forms of service competition through Over-The-Top (OTT) players such as Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime, etc. It is hard to argue that the telecom liberalization concepts designed in the 1980-90s reflect such reality. The fact that telecom regulation often differs country-by-country, and such differences are hard to explain by objective geographic, demographic or other reasons, is another sign of conceptual weakness of today's telecom regulation.2.The so far prevalent concept of net neutrality has created enormous global scale economies and subsequent wealth concentration in the Internet industry, the positive global economic benefits of which are debatable.Net neutrality, a framework in which telecom operators cannot interfere with content, (i.e.",487
75,"they cannot allocate more capacity to YouTube videos over other video services), has so far been prevalent globally. The best analogy to neutral networks is a road system with the same rules for all cars with no toll roads allowed. Neutral networks cannot manage their bottlenecks, guarantee service quality or accommodate special needs for speed and capacity. This has had two consequences. Firstly, the fact that content providers do not pay the telecom operators for delivery of their content has created enormous global scale economies in content aggregation. This has allowed the leaders in different segments, such as the so called GAFA companies (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple), to practically dominate their markets globally. Secondly, the newly emerged Internet industry has been largely consumer-focused as opposed to B2B focused.Owing to scale economies and innovation, the global Internet leaders have created unprecedented value in the last ten years. The world's top five Internet companies are now worth more than the top five telecoms with Apple now reigning as the world's most valuable company. Internet has created unprecedented personal wealth as well, similar to railways, oil, PCs or telecom networks in the past. Key shareholders of the Internet companies such as Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin or Jeff Bezos may be in that sense compared to John Rockefeller, Bill Gates or Carlos Slim.Like the railway, oil, PC and telecom industries, the Internet industry also allows consumers to benefit from technological innovation while disrupting some legacy industries. There is however one significant difference. Railways, oil, PCs and telecom sectors opened up new opportunities for a range of other industries by boosting the efficiency of legacy production processes. This contributed to economic growth and value creation across the economy. Meanwhile, the current Internet aggregators such as the GAFA companies largely bypass legacy industries and target the consumers directly while often disrupting legacy businesses.While this phenomenon empowers the consumer and may even lead to price deflation, its positive impact on the growth of local economies remains debatable. The abundance of free content on platforms such as Facebook may even be seen as diverting users' attention away from economically productive causes. Meanwhile, the Internet industry will continue to have a major disruptive effect on local industries ranging from music, telecoms and media to retail, transportation (e.g. taxi services) and financial services. It is highly unclear whether the adverse economic implications of such disruption will be compensated by the creation of new industries with wide-spread new employment opportunities (such as the app or on-line gaming industry).",496
76,"Relatively advanced economies, which do not directly benefit from the expansion of the Internet industry, appear particularly at risk.Finally, unlike the oil and telecom industries at the time of their rapid growth, today's Internet industry does not directly create large scale new investment or employment opportunities which would drive economic growth. Despite its ability to extract value from economies around the world, the Internet industry's contribution to tax revenue is relatively small as well. That said the Internet industry is playing a positive role in the economy by driving broadband penetration in the developing world, driving crucial R&D projects in the area of robotics and artificial intelligence (including for example driverless cars) and more controversially creating extensive and highly valuable databases about the world's on-line population ( so called big data). Some of these activities may continue supporting economic growth, although this may appear more long-term and less certain compared to the adverse growth implications of the Internet industry's disruptive effects on the legacy industries.Regulation and innovation has so far focused on the consumer, but business innovation needs to drive growthIt is interesting to note that the common denominator of the above-discussed challenges is a highly pro-consumer bias and not always the conceptually sound policies of telecom liberalization and net neutrality. Could a policy overhaul create an environment more supportive of economic growth? In our November 2014 Citi GPS report Re-birth of telecom monopoly: Is the industry broken and heading towards its monopolistic roots?, we addressed the issue of the optimal business model for telecoms and Internet companies. We argued that a regulatory policy overhaul may be desirable not only due to the conceptual weaknesses of the current policies and the saturation of wireless and Internet markets globally, but also due to newly emerging opportunities in technology. Telecom, Media & Technology (TMT) growth in the past ten years was dominated by content aggregation, exploitation of global scale effects and smartphones. We expect future growth will be driven by connected intelligent devices such as robots, driven by the Internet of Things (IoT).There are two key differences between the IoT and the current Internet business models in our view. Firstly, the innovative IoT solutions may be designed, marketed and provided by a wide range of companies across the world, each of them able to purchase connectivity and high tech solutions on a wholesale market. For example a local hospital may provide a specialized personal health monitoring service. The hospital would be able to buy the high-tech solution from a technology company and the necessary connectivity from a telecom company.",494
77,"Secondly, failure of connectivity in the IoT solutions could be detrimental to the usefulness of the final product, potentially including safety and security of their use. Therefore it is imperative that providers of such solutions are able to purchase connectivity at the required quality levels, which may differ based on the type or use of the product. This makes a strong case for so called guaranteed services, i.e. premium quality connectivity at a premium price specifically devised for a certain product. This directly contradicts the net neutrality principle.The key economic benefit of the IoT model compared to the current Internet business model is that it would help to somewhat de-centralize innovation and balance-out its benefits more evenly between the leading Internet and technology companies (such as the GAFA companies) and innovative companies in their respective industries around the world (for example car makers for connected car solutions, universities for education solutions, pharmaceutical and health companies for health solutions etc.). IoT may boost production efficiency and product functionality of the existing products, reduce costs of some products as well as create brand new products such as robotic cars. The fact that this would happen across economies could mitigate some disruptive effects of the Internet-driven innovation on economic growth.Solution: Regulation, which is friendlier to wide-spread business innovationWhy has IoT not made a bigger impact yet? One reason is technological. Robotics and smart technologies take time to develop, while big data takes time to collect and utilize. However, another important reason is regulatory. Telecom and Internet regulation has been driven predominantly by consumer interests, which have so far largely coincided with the interests of the Internet industry such as the GAFA companies. Meanwhile, regulation has not yet taken into account the innovative opportunities in specific industries or regions, which may require different levels of guaranteed connectivity.In our Citi GPS report we outline our SECOND (Selectively Competitive Net De-neutralised) model for telecoms, which attempts to address this problem. It calls for replacing infrastructure competition and potential net neutrality dogmatism with a new concept, which draws a dividing line between the infrastructure (real estate-like) and innovative parts of the telecom businesses. The infrastructure business may be allowed (although not forced) to consolidate and in some areas (such as towers, passive infrastructure, rural broadband access networks, etc.) possibly to re-monopolize.The key issue in infrastructure is consistent application of the wholesale concept in both the monopolized and competitive infrastructure while minimizing synergies between owning infrastructure and providing service on it. This is crucial for two reasons.",496
78,"Firstly, it would open up the communications market to innovators across all industries. Car companies, security companies, financial services companies, gaming companies and others would all be able to offer their service directly to the customer, including connectivity with parameters tailored to the need of the ultimate service. Secondly, abundant choice of communications service providers with access to top infrastructure would effectively remove the need for net neutrality. Service providers would be able to prioritize traffic based on economic needs (e.g. providers of health-related applications may purchase wireless connection with guaranteed reliability while movie download providers may get super-fast speed with less reliability guarantee). Low entry barriers into the service business should in principle prevent service providers from taking unfair advantage of the consumers in the non-net neutral environment, although specific aspects of net neutrality may still be regulated.In a transportation analogy, our SECOND model would compare to a situation when road owners must allow all licensed cars (or transportation companies) to use the roads with the same traffic rules for all. It would be possible, however, for road users to pay a toll for using faster roads or certain tunnels and bridges. Businesses, which fundamentally require fast transportation (e.g. food, transport) would have better conditions to thrive in such an environment. While offering the widest possible access to the basic infrastructure, the SECOND model would also allocate scarce telecom infrastructure capacity to different uses based on their economic value (rather than a principle of equality). This arrangement is in our view not only optimal for using the infrastructure to grow the economy, but it is also the best possible sustainable free-market based driver for infrastructure investments. It should in a way allow the infrastructure investors to benefit from the true economic value of the infrastructure while it removes the costs of unnecessary infrastructure duplication.The ultimate version of our SECOND model is the so called structural separation of telecom infrastructure and service, i.e. full ownership separation, when the infrastructure companies potentially re-monopolize certain markets and exclusively focus on wholesale.",388
79,"The fixed-line structural separation in Australia, the functional separation in the UK fixed-line, the tower and network consolidation currently ongoing around the world, the ongoing net neutrality debate on both sides of the Atlantic, the recent Google MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) deal in the US and the world’s first ever incumbent-driven proposal for full (fixed-line and mobile) structural separation by O2 Czech Republic can all be seen as moves closer to the SECOND model.Obstacles facing the SECOND model and opportunities for EuropeDespite the above-discussed developments, it has so far been hard to see too much enthusiasm around the world for overhauling telecom and Internet regulation to support across the board economic growth. Why? The reason may be that stakeholders who could benefit from such an overhaul have so far been less vocal than those who may face the risks. Shareholders of the leading telecom operators may benefit from structural separation, but telecom executives may naturally see destabilization of the established business models as risky, particularly for companies with 'empire building’ strategies. The Internet companies led by GAFA would naturally be careful about any model which may force them to share more value with infrastructure owners, other companies or governments. Meanwhile, the public and its political representatives may also be sensitive about compromising the net neutrality concept, which is often linked to freedom of speech and portrayed as one of the key achievements of the past decades. Finally, industries that could potentially benefit from compromised net neutrality and the IoT, or lose out if the status quo is sustained, have not yet joined the debate with a strong voice.Another barrier to application of the SECOND model ideas is the current state of the telecom and Internet industries in different countries. The US for example does not have a well-developed wholesale market in fixed-line broadband access. It is also hosting a large share of the global tech and Internet industry, which materially contributes to its economic growth. This, along with strong political opposition against anti-neutral regulation, complicates potential compromise on net neutrality there. Meanwhile, Europe has historically recognized wholesale competition in telecoms as a principle, it has largely missed out on the Internet (content aggregation) opportunity while it has leadership in certain industries (e.g. manufacturing such as cars), which may potentially benefit from moving into the IoT or lose from staying out.",459

The Curtain Falls- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle22 Oct 2015The Curtain FallsHow Silicon Valley is Challenging HollywoodCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadEric Schmidt, Google's CEO once said: Authors: Jason B Bazinet,Michael Rollins, CFA,Catherine T O’Neill,Thomas A Singlehurst, CFA,Mark May,“The Internet is the first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn’t understand… the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.”An ‘experiment in anarchy’... that’s an interesting phrase.Merriam-Webster defines anarchy as “wild behavior in which the people in a group are not controlled by rules or laws.” ‘Not controlled by rules or laws’…another interesting phrase.We could synthesize the two quotes this way: “The Internet allows rules to be broken.” And, virtually everything in the pre-Internet media ecosystem is governed by rules. The rules aren’t arbitrary. Rather, they’re dictated by the hard, profit-maximizing logic of microeconomics. Here are a few examples:  In the past, if you wanted to sell video, you needed something scarce: Hundreds of billions in capital to pass every home with coaxial cable. Or, a fleet of geosynchronous satellites orbiting the earth. In the new, post-Internet world, to sell video you need…a web server.   In the pre-Internet world, if you wanted to reach a large audience, only a handful of places would take your ad: the Olympics, the World Cup or the Super Bowl. Today, you use Facebook.   In the pre-Internet world, to advertise to specific audiences, you used crude demographic measures: women over 50 years old, for example. With the Internet, you target a particular person.   In the past, if you wanted to watch an entire season of a TV show, you needed a DVR. Or, you could buy an expensive DVD box-set. Today, you watch it on Netflix.   In the past, if you wanted to watch a particular channel, your pay TV firm would force you to buy a bundle of 200 channels.

Debt Problem Unsolved - Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle06 Feb 2013Debt Problem UnsolvedCiti GPS Opinion ArticleCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsContributor(s):  Steven C WietingShareThe last-minute agreement to avoid the US “fiscal cliff” — with an increase in only the top marginal income tax rate, some limits on tax deductions and exclusions, and delays in spending cuts — has generated a legitimate relief about the U.S. fiscal outlook, but also complacency about a poor structural budget imbalance.Fiscal tightening could have been far more severe had the full “cliff” hammered all taxpayers to a greater extent and new spending cuts had begun straight away. We share a bullish outlook with market participants who are relieved that the U.S. hasn’t succumbed to self-defeating fiscal tightening. Yet, in our view, a lack of significant structural spending reforms at such an opportune and critical time leaves a U.S. economic vulnerability wide open.Resisting the austerity measures seen in parts of Europe, at least to the most extreme extent, has been rewarded in financial markets, which, in turn, supports the immediate strength of the U.S. economy. After the severe retrenchment of 2008–09 and a significant repositioning of the business and consumer sectors, we believe U.S. growth will reach about 3% in the second half of 2013 and persist — providing a stronger pace than seen over all but short bursts of the recovery to date. The absence of further fiscal tightening has strengthened the outlook without generating a much higher price for U.S. borrowing.With unemployment still widespread and historically high, immediate tax increases and spending cuts always seemed poorly timed. However, some have now taken to arguing that beyond the modest tightening steps just announced, no significant further attention to debt and deficits is warranted. “There’s a reasonable argument for leaving the question of how to deal with future problems up to future politicians,” wrote economist Paul Krugman in the New York Times on January 17, 2013. As we see it, this seems akin to relying on future technological advancements in medicine to justify smoking and a high-fat diet.",464
82,"Practically speaking, we believe attention to the long term would make the immediate task of achieving a full recovery easier, not harder.The Case for Near-Term SupportThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that a multi-year persistent rise of one percentage point in the U.S. unemployment rate above its sustainable trend is consistent with a 0.2 percentage point increase in the structural or sustainable unemployment rate (i.e., the rate of permanent unemployment). This is because the long-term unemployed see a degradation of their skills and hence their ability to become reemployed — so-called labor market “hysteresis”.(1)At present, the U.S. has seen the unemployment rate average about three percentage points higher than estimates of full employment over a full five-year time frame. Unemployment throughout the period has also been higher than measures assumed within the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO’s) long-term budget projections. It seems likely that some of the 3–4 million individuals actively seeking work for a year or longer (and many others who have been reluctant to search) have been harmed with respect to their more lasting employment prospects. As such, the sustainable non-inflationary full employment rate or “natural” rate may have already drifted toward 6% from pre-crisis estimates of 5%– 5 ½%.Evidence suggests a one percentage point trend rise in the unemployment rate could worsen the U.S. structural budget deficit by about ½ percentage point of GDP and potentially much more over a shorter-term window. The longer-term implications for U.S. interest costs from funding this deficit — including the effects of compounding — depend on whether the increase is offset with greater fiscal tightening steps, which conceivably might increase the negative impact somewhat further.Today’s lack of interest rate pressures doesn’t mean an absence of all negative impact from budget deficits. Deficits require savers to finance them. Those savings flows could ordinarily be used for building up the productive capital stock of the U.S. economy. This is not a concern we have on a short-term or cyclical basis when the economy is depressed as it is now, but it is acute when considering the impact on long-term economic performance.The structural U.S. budget deficit — the deficit the remains when estimated cyclical weakness is adjusted away — was last estimated by the CBO in 2012 at -4.4% of U.S. GDP.",492
83,"The permanent tax increases of about 0.5 percentage point of GDP that were announced in January would lower that estimate to below 4% going forward. But labor market hysteresis could move the estimate in a negative direction by at least an equal magnitude. Thus, large budget deficits would re-emerge in coming years even after an improvement in the economy.The growth in the private capital stock has historically and rather consistently been the best determinant of real economic growth and wages paid per worker. Structural budget deficits that absorb savings from other uses (whether through higher taxes or just higher government consumption) contribute to slower potential economic growth and real incomes, even if there is no crisis-induced interest rate spike in sight. Persistent budget deficits may be consistent with maintaining the low interest rates and weak real economic growth expectations currently priced in markets, rather than spiking them higher as often feared. The point of deficit reduction is not the achievement of higher or lower interest rates in isolation. Instead, economic stability and future living standards are in question.Why Not Ignore the Long Run for Now?Evidence, in our view, seems to side with the case that immediate recovery will have benefits for the fiscal outlook that outstrip the long-run costs of current budget deficits.So, why pay any attention to deficit reduction at all? For the simplest reason, long-term structural reforms would provide room for less immediate austerity. A test of this will be seen as Congress alters or fails to alter the immediate onset of sequestration in about a month’s time. These are the large immediate spending cuts of about $85 billion over the remainder of 2013 and $110 billion per year in the following nine years. These nearly arbitrary cuts to defense and non-defense federal spending were set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 as a blunt attempt to force more carefully crafted spending restraints.As noted, to the extent that federal spending cuts in the coming few years hold back full recovery, they will also tend to worsen long-term unemployment. This carries its own lasting fiscal consequence.As an easy example of the structural reforms that could offset some of the immediate tightening under sequestration, we consider the impact of a slightly less generous inflation adjustment for Social Security payments and future tax brackets by switching to a so-called “chained Consumer Price Index (CPI)” from the current fixed-weight index basket.A first impact is to very slowly alter the growth of Social Security transfer payments by 0.3 percentage point a year.",494
84,"This provides a very sizeable 10-year budget savings estimated in 2010 by the CBO at about $108 billion; or nearly equal to a full year’s spending cuts under the Budget Control Act (sequestration). The impact of slower upward adjustments to income tax brackets (meaning gradually higher taxes) and savings on federal pensions sums up to a larger $113 billion. (2) For all components, such a change alone could offset nearly one fifth of sequestration, if so desired.Most likely reflecting a different 10-year window under which calculations are based, our own more recent calculations show a permanent and immediate switch to the chained CPI would save $175 billion from Social Security Cost of Living Adjustments alone. More interestingly, the same calculation shows $810 billion in nominal savings in the following 10 years and $2.1 trillion in the decade after. This is largely because Social Security payments — the smaller imbalance in long-term mandatory spending programs — are expected to grow faster than the underlying economy in coming decades. (For 30 years, we estimate $2 trillion in savings in real, 2012 dollars).The so-called CPI fix could represent a structural fiscal tightening of perhaps 0.4 percentage points of GDP without making a single outright spending cut. This estimate excludes the measureable fiscal impact from slower adjustments to tax brackets and other inflation indexed federal programs that would nearly approach the savings in Social Security.Importantly, a slower growth rate of payments may seem imperceptibly small in the near term. Under such a change, total Social Security payments would rise $34 billion in the coming year instead of $36 billion, we estimate. For recipients, the average monthly benefit would likely increase about $50 instead of $53. In contrast, sequestration if implemented would make sizeable outright spending cuts and have little if any permanent value for the long-term budget imbalance.Implementing a CPI change would do several things at once. It would simultaneously improve the long-term fiscal deficit and extend the solvency of the Social Security system itself. It could also allow a partial alternative to near-term spending cuts that would contribute to higher structural unemployment and budget deficits.The “fairness” of adjustments to the CPI can and will be hotly debated. But both the sustainability and cost of the program should be considered in the calculus.",471
85,"If the public would prefer higher tax rates to fully fund it, a boost to the inflation adjustment could be made instead of a cut.Why should Social Security be forced to “economize” a bit or even run surpluses at the expense of beneficiaries? Standing alone, it shouldn’t. But because healthcare spending is causing a downward spiral in other budget priorities including education and infrastructure, in our view, it seems unreasonable to shield other forms of age-based social supports from all economic spillovers. Our estimates suggest eliminating long-term funding shortfalls in entitlement programs would take a rough tripling of current Social Security and Medicare tax rates. In our view, the public should be given the choice to either fully fund these programs or gradually alter their scope and size.Aside from providing greater flexibility to avoid near-term tightening in the sequester battle, it’s clear to us that the longer the U.S. waits to make adjustments to the fiscal imbalance, the more difficult the ultimate adjustments will prove. In a 2010 study, the CBO estimated that required fiscal adjustment to stabilize federal debt — whether through tax increases or benefit cuts — roughly doubles if the onset of adjustment is put off by 10 years. (3)ConclusionIn the aftermath of the January 1 budget agreement, some Republicans rejoiced as future tax increases are now absent from current law, even as taxes are insufficient to fully fund future spending commitments. Some Democrats, meanwhile, rejoiced that no ground at all was conceded on entitlements. But why not rally around saving Medicare and Social Security for the long run? Why act as though the stabilizing long-term reforms are mere bargaining chips or sad compromises?We don’t want observers to be overwhelmed by the many mere extrapolations inevitable in long-term analysis. One recent CBO scenario showed the U.S. paying off all Federal debt by 2070, another had the federal debt/GDP ratio tripling by 2040. There are many great uncertainties, but our outlook is for a cyclical, if stunted, recovery in the U.S. fiscal position. With it, the momentum for needed long-term reforms may die. If so, the latter CBO scenario would seem the more likely.(1) Please see ""Assessing the Impact of the Financial Crisis on Structural Unemployment on OECD Countries"", Guichard and Rusticelli (2010), OECD Economics Department Working Papers, No.",487

Digital Disruption Revisited- Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle20 Jan 2017Digital Disruption - RevisitedWhat FinTech VC Investments Tells Us About a Changing IndustryCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownload2016 was the year when the Chinese FinTech dragons roared and some previously feted Western leaders wilted. In our first Digital Disruption GPS report, we argued that China was very important to the FinTech story (March 2016, link here). In this follow-on report, we follow the venture capital (VC) and corporate investments money trail to revisit the theme of the Chinese FinTech dragons as they roar at home and expand overseas.Our conclusion: the rise of the Chinese dragons reflects a unique combination over the past decade of incredibly rapid ‎digitization and the simultaneous rise of the Chinese mass middle class, along with poorly prepared incumbent financial institutions facing off against entrepreneurial e-commerce and social media ecosystems. It is no surprise to us that China accounted for over 50% of total FinTech investments globally in the first nine months of 2016 (9M 2016) and was the only major region where FinTech investments increased in 2016 — in fact doubling in China in the first nine months of 2016 versus the same period in 2015. ‎In this report we also take a look at how different the FinTech evolution has been in the West: (1) the U.S. pivoted to InsurTech in 2016; and (2) two of the largest U.S. FinTech VC funding rounds in 2016 were in the health insurance space. Big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices, among other trends, will help insurance companies use FinTech to be more creative and customized. So far the InsurTech focus is more about improving distribution efficiency and user experience, as with much B2C FinTech in general.Lending hasn't gone away. Our VC contributors for this report remain enthusiastic about peer-to-peer lending as an opportunity, especially in China or emerging markets where it is about financial inclusion and accessing underserved clients. By contrast, in the U.S. it has often been a (sub-prime/near-prime) credit card debt consolidation play.",482
87,"Lending accounts for about 80% of 9M 2016 VC FinTech investments ex-U.S. — but if we exclude Asia from our data (basically China), then the share of lending drops to sub-30%.Europe remains a laggard for start-ups/VC investing at about 10% of global FinTech VC investment in‎ 2015-16. This is not a big surprise as Europe has a smaller VC market versus the U.S., it has none of the large technology/Internet companies that exist in the U.S. or China and its banking system (despite the sector’s weak stock prices, earnings and capital challenges of the past decade) offers more of a full-service provision versus U.S. or Chinese peers.European banks are among the top investors in VC-backed FinTech companies led by Spanish banks Banco Santander and BBVA (if we include Propel Ventures). European banks are increasingly interested in FinTech and with more bank investors and affiliates, we will see more of a shift to business-to-business (B2B).‎ In 2017 we expect more focus on B2B FinTech topics, such as Artificial Intelligence, especially in London which is a hotspot with DeepMind and its concentration of universities; regulatory tech both in the U.K. and the U.S.; and cybersecurity primarily in the U.S. and Israel.Back in the business-to-consumer (B2C) world, 2017 will also be the year when the Chinese dragons continue to make progress in expanding outside their home market, albeit this will not be the strategic ""Blue Ocean"" that China was a decade ago.‎ The simple call for us to make is that Alipay will grow internationally as it follows the ongoing expansion of overseas Chinese tourism. The harder call is how many non-Chinese clients will Chinese companies like Ant Financial and WeChat gain in payments and associated products.In the second half of this report, we switch from our analytical conclusions to highlights from our discussions in recent months with eight leading FinTech VC'S who are based across the world and in many of the key FinTech industry hotspots.",430

Digital Disruption- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountVideo30 Mar 2016Digital DisruptionHow FinTech is Forcing Banking to a Tipping PointCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadWith advances in technology, the relationship that customers have with their bank and with their finances has changed. Customers rely less and less on walking into a branch for their banking needs, and instead have digital options to help them —ATMs, on-line chat, mobile phones, and Internet banking. So far these have been seen more as additive to a customer's banking experience but when do we go over the digital disruption tipping point and see a change in the fundamental banking business?Investments in financial technology have grown exponentially in the past decade — rising from $1.8 billion in 2010 to $19 billion in 2015 — with over 70% of this investment focusing on the ""last mile"" of user experience in the consumer space. The majority of this investment has also been concentrated in the payments area and this is where banks are seeing the most competition with new entrants. Competitors already established in new marketplaces, such as PayPal for e-commerce payments in the U.S., or emerging in client segments traditionally underserved by banks (such as micro and small businesses) are starting to gain traction and ramp up their scale.Despite all of the investment and continuous speculation about banks facing extinction, only about 1% of North American consumer banking revenue has migrated to new digital models. Although FinTech companies have the advantage of new innovation, incumbent financial institutions still have the upper hand in terms of scale and we have not yet reached the tipping point of digital disruption in either the U.S. or Europe. Given the growth in FinTech investment, this isn't likely to continue for long.In China, Internet giants have moved into financial services and gained considerable market share in e-commerce and third-party payments. These new entrants were faster than the banks to offer convenient, reliable, fast and cost-efficient alternatives to traditional bank payments.",431

Fast forward to 2013 and scholars are arguing that the golden days of innovation are behind us and although there will still be inventions and discoveries, they will pale in comparison with the great innovations of the past.Whether or not you believe that future innovation can do the past justice, innovation provides a channel for organizations to adapt and respond to a changing environment. It can accelerate the growth of new businesses and provides corporates the coveted opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Disruptive innovations are the game changers and the ultimate Holy Grail as they meaningfully change the way customers live their lives and interact with the world.For an organization to move from “hits and misses” to highly predictable innovation outcomes and disruptive market offerings, a disciplined approach with a standardized process needs to be implemented as the best innovators combine rigorous process discipline with creativity and inspiration. It is a mission critical process but few companies get it right from start to finish.In the pages that follow, we give thought to the process of innovation for an organization by identifying the elements of success, the stages of innovation and the benefits of implementing an Innovation Lab strategy. The end-game for an organization is to execute quickly and effectively and increase their flexibility and ability to adapt to both a changing industry and client landscape.We then attempt to identify 10 ‘disruptive innovations’, new technologies or ideas which we believe will help create a new market and potentially disrupt an existing market or displace an earlier technology in an investable timeframe.",438
91,"Although the technology sector historically dominates the group — we note the advancement of 3D printing, software as a service (SaaS) and software defined networking (SDN) — technology advancements are driving innovation in a wide-range of industries.The advent of e-cigarettes has given the tobacco industry its first innovation in decades while advances in sequencing instruments has reduced the cost of whole genome sequencing to levels where personalized medicine is no longer science fiction. In energy, new technologies in subsea processing and fracking have made previously unrecoverable resources accessible and are driving the future of transportation, while technology advancement in solar change will change how power is generated. Finally, everyday activities going foward — like how we bank and watch TV — will be significantly different from even the last decade due to innovation.In the end the attribution of the invention quote to Mr. Duell was debunked.",172

Disruptive Innovations II- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountDisruptive Innovation SeriesArticle07 May 2014Disruptive Innovations IITen More Things to Stop and Think AboutCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadDisruptive innovation is a term that was first coined in 1995 by Harvard Business School Professors Clayton Christensen and Joseph Bower and explains how “a market or sector is transformed by introducing simplicity, convenience, accessibility and affordability where complication and high cost are the status quo.” For the most part, when people think about disruptive innovation, technology is the first thing that comes to mind — smartphones, flat-screen TVs, MP3 players — things that have come on the market that have totally replaced products that we had and make us think “how did we ever live without this wonderful machine”.But disruption can be so much more than just a better way to listen to music. Disruptive innovation can be found in both products and processes — i.e. how we do something is just as disruptive to the status quo as the new technology that enables us to do it. Going back to the advent of the ATM machine, both the technology itself was disruptive, but so was the process — we no longer had to go to a bank to deposit a check or withdraw cash. In this same vein, mobile phones as a technology were disruptive to fixed telephony, but the ability to conduct banking transactions and to pay for goods and services over this new technology is a change in process that has disrupted many industries.In this new report, Disruptive Innovations II, we take a look at some new sectors where new products could potentially disrupt a market. Four of the ideas that we highlight are related to themes we introduced in our April 2013 report. Following up on personalized medicine, we analyze the $35 billion opportunity in immunotherapy which uses the patients’ immune system to fight cancer cells and has the potential to transform cancer from a deadly disease into a chronic disease akin to HIV. In technology, we progress from 3D printing to 4D printing by adding the dimension of self-assembly to a 3D printer-generated object.",462
94,"In solar technology, we note the recent rapid uptake of solar in Germany and Japan and how new technologies in energy storage are emerging that should remove more of the cost barriers for solar adoption and also reduce the cost of electric vehicles. Finally, in banking we expand our thoughts on mobile payments and look at how mobile payments have digitalized banking in general and raised financial inclusion, especially in emerging markets.There are also some different areas of innovation in this new report. Typically thought of as a sleepy industry, insurance wouldn’t normally be thought of as a place where you would find disruptive innovation. But the latest surge in insurance securitization through the issuance of insurance-linked securities (ILS) has disrupted the market and forced industry players to consider potentially radical changes to their existing strategies. The emergence of digital advertising could breathe life into an industry that was becoming commoditized while farmers are looking to new technologies to greatly enhance productivity in one of society’s oldest professions. Other innovations may change how we do basic things in the future: how we drive (possibly with electric vehicles), what we use for cash (digital currency) and who our colleagues are at work (maybe R2D2 and CP3O).Authors: Erik J Bass, CFA,Todd Bault, FCAS,Andrew S Baum,Jason Channell,Dr. Steven Englander, Phd,Ronit Ghose,Simon Ho, CFA,Deborah Hopkins,P.J.

At the time, there was also a growing debate surfacing over the lack of economic growth in the U.S. and whether it was due to a lack of innovation. We disagreed then that there was a lack of innovation and two years down the road we stick with our position. We see the pace of technological change accelerating as we move into a new Digital Age, helped by the continued decline in the cost of innovation coupled with increased interest in funding innovation.In this new report, Disruptive Innovations III, we once again take a look at some of the newest concepts across sectors and identify new products which could potentially disrupt the marketplace. What stands out in the report this year is the size of the expected market opportunities for each product. In financial innovations alone, a combination of marketplace banking (peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding) and Robo-Advisors touch a total addressable market of over $5.3 trillion. Autonomous driving along with the overall sharing economy could jointly be a $435 billion opportunity by 2030.Also different this time is the increasing synergies between the different innovations. Driverless vehicles that facilitate “robotic taxis” should also enhance the sharing economy through companies such as Uber and Lyft. Virtual competitions designed to accelerate the pace of digital banking innovation, such as the Citi Mobile Challenge, wouldn’t be possible without the availability of public application program interfaces (APIs). As it continues to improve, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI) is increasingly disruptive through direct impact and as a building block for other innovative technologies. The use and impact of MLAI can be seen as a factor in most of our highlighted innovations.Autonomous driving, a topic we covered in detail in Car of the Future v2.0, is moving from concept to reality with 2020 now forecast as the start of the ‘driverless era’.",483

Virtual and augmented reality has progressed to the point that computer games will soon behave more like the holodeck in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Even in places where we’ve already highlighted disruptive innovations, we’re seeing disruption being disrupted. Immunotherapy manufacturers, which we highlighted as disrupting the pharmaceutical market last year through targeted cancer treatments, are now being disrupted themselves with the advent of generic competition through biosimilars.

A few of the “new” concepts are derivatives of innovations we have explored in the past. Technology-related concepts dominate the list this year and span across a range of sectors — from retail to and education to farming.We start by looking at the areas where innovation and financing are coming together through the amount of venture capital (VC) funding by theme. Although total growth in venture capital funding increased steadily between 2010 and 2020, investments roughly doubled in 2021 to $723 billion. Despite optimism these levels would continue, VC funding has pulled back in 2022. On the sustainability front, we continue to highlight innovations to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Vertical farming, where plants or crops are grown indoors in vertically stacked layers, use less water, fertilizer, and land than conventional farming, leading to lower emissions. The acceleration of automation capabilities in vertical farms has also improved its scalability and profitability. Advancements in sodium-ion batteries, which use sodium instead of metals such as lithium to generate charge, have lower material costs and lower supply chain pressures due to the abundance of sodium around the world than current battery technologies. These advantages could drive electric vehicle penetration rates. In terms of power generation, small modular nuclear reactors could be disruptive to global energy markets, stabilizing power prices and shifting incentives away from gas and coal power generation throughout the world. Innovations in technology can potentially change the way we shop, access the internet, organize not only data but corporate structures, gain education, and produce high-performing computers. Social commerce is transforming the way shoppers interact with merchandise but also how retailers inform their product roadmaps. Households and small businesses may soon be cutting their fixed broadband cords for wireless broadband access that can also expand the addressable market for broadband services. Upskilling through online professional learning, qualifications, and credentialing, could either disrupt universities or help them adapt to changes in learner preferences.",488

So we re-thought and cast our net wider, and put a new slate together. But for some reason, we still couldn’t muster up a load of excitement. Mildly dejected, we started to speak to people outside of our circle and that’s when we had an ‘aha!’ moment and realized that over the years we had immersed ourselves in so many publications and websites that much like ‘innovation junkies’, it was taking more and more for us to get excited about things that could be disruptive and change the future. Looking at our list with new eyes — more like the ones we had when we started this series five years ago — we now have here what we think is thought-provoking and fantastic.Imagine going to the doctor and having a routine blood test that can scan your body for cancer tumors. Or being told that your child was born with a genetic disease but then finding out it can be ‘cured’ by injecting a virus which can edit the defective gene. Both of those things are possible in the near future with the advent of liquid biopsy techniques and CRISPR-based gene editing.In transportation, robotic piloting in commercial jets could mean that your flight is unmanned and that the days of your plane being delayed because the pilot is stuck in traffic on the way to the airport are long gone. Or maybe you don’t want to take that short-haul flight at all, and instead could jump into a Hyperloop pod that shoots you 700mph in a vacuum tube to your destination. Artificial intelligence-piloted planes and Hyperloop systems could be the driver of new transportation modes.In financials, it seems like there are new breakthroughs in FinTech almost every day. The same is true for Internet of Things (IoT) where a positive environment is emerging as the number of connected devices is increasing and high-speed bandwidth is being widely deployed.",497
99,"We look at how adding a payments layer to any IoT construct helps the proliferation and monetization of IoT use cases. Blockchain — primarily known as the basis for cryptocurrency — could soon be used to change how we trade physical commodities, but also how our local electricity market operates. And in an attempt to take back share from passive managers, active investment managers are disrupting their pricing models by considering a performance-oriented fee structure.Robots designed to replace humans through the automation of factory floors has been a trend for a few years, but new developments in end-of-arm tools for robots which aim to mimic the function of the human hand could mean that we will see robots performing a new range of jobs and functions. On the flip side, new low-code development platforms are coming that will facilitate the rise of the “citizen developer” who can create software applications for the business world without the need of a traditional software developer and thereby bridge the gap between the supply of developers and the demand for application development. Finally, we look at the next generation of tobacco — Heat Not Burn tobacco — which gives the user the enjoyment of a traditional cigarette without the smell and harmful smoke.And we start it all off with a look at what big companies can do to transform themselves into innovators.",251

On a Monday you’ve never heard of a Click Clack, a Pet Rock, a Furby, or a Fidget Spinner, but by what seems like the lunchtime, you can’t turn a corner or walk past a school playground without seeing them everywhere. Innovation has the same feeling as a fad — we go from not thinking we need a mobile phone to not being able to leave the house without it. Over the past few years, it feels like this technological change is accelerating. But is it?    Vanessa Colella, Chief Innovation Officer at Citi, writes that innovation isn’t always instantaneous: The hardest challenges to identify and react to are the ones that arise slowly. Large-scale societal, economic, and technological trends that emerge gradually and continuously over time are easily overlooked, but in reality it is these trends that can create the biggest impact. Tracking slow change, she notes, by asking which trends are impacting businesses and clients in ways that are both accelerating and irreversible can help to create improved systems that reduce friction or shift society in such a way that returning to the old practices seems inconceivable.In this new report, we once again look at some of the leading-edge concepts across sectors and identify new products that could ultimately disrupt the marketplace. One notable point is that a number of the concepts we look at have actually been around for a while — all-solid-state batteries, anti-aging medicines, eSports and offshore wind turbines — but something has changed in each of them, such that we’re now at a tipping point of accelerated adoption. Telecoms take a spotlight this year with two new concepts: 5G and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA).",453
101,"5G technology has been under discussion for the past five years, and although unlikely to show major improvements in consumer smartphones, we see huge potential in commercial and industrial areas such as connected & autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, digital health, and smart cities. DSA works in conjunction with this by disrupting the model currently used for wireless spectrum allocation.In healthcare, the search for the fountain of youth goes back hundreds of years, and attempts by modern medicine have historically failed. But today, there is a new breakthrough in the understanding of why we age could lead to novel drugs on the market by 2023. Healthcare data — the result of electronic health-record legislation in 2009 — is growing by leaps and bounds, and new tools like artificial intelligence, machine-learning and natural language-processing will help drive data utilization and lower healthcare costs.Autonomous vehicles (AV) could be available in the mid-2020s and create new ways to use cars, with RoboTaxi driverless car services and AV Subscription ownership, while the development of all-solid-state batteries could accelerate the uptake of battery electric vehicles. eSports could eclipse traditional league sports for viewership and sponsorship, wind generation uptake can be accelerated by the use of floating wind-turbines in deep waters, buying and selling a house can be transformed with FinTech solutions, and smart assistants could be the primary interaction with data queries in the near future.Hope you can avoid the acceleration and slow down to read the report.

This year again, there are a few concepts that have been around for quite a while — nuclear fusion and quantum computing — which have required a technological breakthrough to become reality. With nuclear fusion, we note there has been talk of a solution in the ‘next 20 years’ for about the past 50 years, but interest in the topic has recently peaked again with the increased global focus on renewable energy and the concept is only one small breakthrough away from becoming reality. Quantum computing is another subject talked about as perpetually on the horizon, but progress is accelerating here and we think that we could be close to a tipping point in technology in the near future.In healthcare, we once again are spoiled for choice in terms of the ideas and concepts that are quickly coming down the pike. Robotic surgery makes up just 2% of all surgical procedures currently, but with advancements in visualization and robotics, this looks set to accelerate to almost 15% by 2030. Virtual healthcare is just starting to gain a foothold with the advent of telehealth, but going forward, we see it expanding to broader technology-enabled healthcare, spanning from urgent care all the way to chronic condition management and remote surgery — effectively replacing the four walls of a hospital with the patients’ home. Gene therapies, which are increasingly being reviewed and approved by regulators have the potential to make untreatable diseases treatable, eliminate some currently treated disease markets, transform the drug payer system, and increase the rate of drug development. Finally, we investigate the benefits and challenges of using probiotics as preventative medicine and an alternative to immune-related drug therapies   There is also a focus on sustainable innovation. Outside of simply emitting less carbon dioxide, we find carbon dioxide removal technology, such as carbon capture and storage/sequestration could be on the near horizon along with carbon pricing.",481

Psychedelic drugs have been around in various forms since the 1950s, and despite promise at the time, regulation kept the class of drugs on the sideline. Today, their benefits are being explored in conditions such as treatment-resistant depression and anxiety. Plant-based alternative proteins are already changing the traditional “meat” households put on the dinner table, but new lab-grown cultured meat, with better taste and a eventually lower price, could become the next alternative protein. Sustainable innovation remains a big focus not only for governments, corporates, and investors, but also innovation. The battle on climate change has continued in earnest and the need to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become even more of a global priority. Removing carbon dioxide for the benefit of the planet is explored in three ways: (1) nature-based solutions, including afforestation and reforestation; (2) enhanced natural processes, including land management and bioengineered plants; and (3) direct air capture (DAC) — the “alchemy of air,” where machines capture carbon dioxide straight out of the atmosphere. In past issues, we’ve explored innovations in green transportation, including hydrogen-powered rail, autonomous vehicle networks, hyperloop, and electric vehicles. This year we look at the use of ammonia as a fuel in jet engines. Although hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels are further along as potential renewables solutions, most jet engines can be retrofitted to use ammonia, it is easily storable, and there is already an ecosystem for production and distribution in place.",462
104,"Finally, we explore how to close the recycling loop using  de-polymerization methods that will avoid plastic waste filling our landfills.2021 has been a great year for innovation in healthcare. mRNA was largely unproven in 2020 despite decades of scientific research, but today has become one of the most powerful weapons against the pandemic. Given the rapid proof-of-concept for mRNA vaccines during COVID-19, we now know that mRNA can produce highly effective and safe vaccines — and COVID-19 vaccines could be just the tip of the iceberg.Finally, a report on disruptive innovations wouldn’t be complete without looking at some new technology. The introduction and increasing popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) coupled with the transition of retail into the metaverse highlights the blending of fintech with both consumer and gaming. Semiconductor manufacturing is on the verge of transforming from two-dimensional to three-dimensional architecture, which could increase the speed of chips by five-fold.

Disruptors at the Gate- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle04 Apr 2018Disruptors at the GateStrategic M&A for Managing Disruptive InnovationCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadTechnological disruption — driven by the emergence of complementary technologies including artificial intelligence, big data, and digital connectivity, among others — is fundamentally transforming the global economy. Market leaders across all sectors are facing unprecedented challenges to their competitive positions as rapid innovation has enabled technology companies to cross traditional sector boundaries.For firms outside the technology sector, addressing the impacts of disruption is now a strategic imperative as organic innovation through R&D alone is often proving insufficient in addressing these seismic shifts in competitive landscapes. Instead, these firms are increasingly pursuing acquisitions of technology companies to acquire new digital capabilities and expertise. In 2017, non-technology companies accounted for two-thirds of all acquisitions of technology companies and 80% of global deal volume involving technology targets over $1bn in size was motivated by disruption.Based on a detailed analysis of all disruption-driven M&A since 2010, we find that investor receptivity to acquisitions involving technology firms has been highly positive. Buyers in such deals have experienced one-year share price outperformance of 7.3%, far outpacing the performance for firms announcing other types of deals and alternative forms of capital deployment.Underlying this sharp uptick in M&A motivated by technological disruption has been a wide range of strategic motivations. These have ranged from acqui-hire strategies to recruit new talent, acquiring platforms that enable new market opportunities or strengthen existing business models, consolidating acquisitions, and, in some cases, acquisitions of a disruptive new entrant itself. Across these diverse strategies, investors have responded much more positively to acquisitions that have been proactive in nature. Proactive deals — that disrupt an existing business, allow access to nascent markets, or acquire a disruptor — deemed to be transformative have been particularly well received, with one-year acquirer outperformance reaching 18.0%.M&A transactions designed to address technological disruption typically involve targets that exhibit high valuation multiples driven by high growth rates — both of which can often exceed those of the acquirer. Therefore, balancing the strategic merits of disruption-motivated M&A with its financial impacts should be of particular focus.",486

Eliminating PovertyOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesArticle07 Feb 2022Eliminating PovertyThe Importance of a Multidimensional Approach in Tackling SDG 1Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadExecutive SummaryThe first of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) is to end poverty. While one of the benefits of globalization over the past 30 years has been the reduction in absolute rates of poverty worldwide, poverty is often still simply measured in terms of income levels. Yet poverty is multifaceted and reflects more than a deficiency of income and productive resources. It encompasses economic, social, cultural, and political elements and is inherently interwoven with a lack of fundamental human rights. According to the UN, its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, inequality, social discrimination and exclusion, deprivation, inadequate access to education and basic services, as well as lack of participation in decision-making. To make progress towards poverty reduction, we need to consider ways to mobilize more investors and businesses to adopt this goal.This report represents an exciting collaboration between Citi and SOPHIA Oxford, which was formed by Oxford University as a not-for-profit partner of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). Over the past decade, OPHI has developed the field of multidimensional measurement, focused primarily on poverty and well-being, expanding its research and social policy uses. The OPHI multidimensional poverty approach has been adopted in official measures of poverty by the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, and more than 30 countries. In this report, Citi’s researchers and data scientists have partnered with the SOPHIA Oxford team to help bring this world class methodology more broadly to the business world. Eliminating poverty and reducing inequalities can deliver substantial growth, and the private sector has a key role to play in making this happen. The good news is that investors are increasingly embracing the UN SDGs and aligning their investment strategies to the 17 goals. The challenge is for these funds to be effectively targeted and their impact measured. This is more important than ever as the world starts to recover from the COVID-19 crisis because the pandemic has increased the gap to achieving several SDGs, including SDG 1 — No Poverty.",474

What’s more these trends are somewhat independent of still other new factors that also challenge the role of petroleum in global vehicle fleets and the growth rate of oil demand. What’s unclear is the pace of growth of natural gas and the extent of the inroads that can be made.The four base trends fostering the natural gas challenge are: 1) the accelerating growth rate of natural gas availability globally, with newly booked gas reserve bookings now consistently about double new oil reserves; 2) the breaking of the traditional link between wellhead oil and gas prices – especially in North America – and the overwhelming economic incentives to develop mechanisms to change the link breakage into a cost advantage in the transportation fuel market; 3) the ability of governments, especially in emerging markets with abundant gas resources, to cap natural gas prices at levels that allow compressed natural gas (CNG) and perhaps liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicles to be more attractive to vehicle owners; and 4) the popular and growing concerns about environmental damage associated with petroleum product use, leading to tightening specifications of petroleum products that open the door for natural gas (via CNG or LNG) to play a growing role in the marine transportation, heavy duty truck and rail transport markets. These trends are building momentum and mutually reinforcing one another at the same time that new engine and battery technologies are emerging that rely on non-hydrocarbon propellants, including electricity, both as supplements to gasoline and diesel and as fuel sources that can supplant them. And, coinciding with all of these factors is a different monkey wrench – massive improvements in automobile and truck fuel efficiencies, which while reducing the pace of petroleum product demand growth, can also limit the attraction and pace of development of natural gas use in the transport fuel market. Equally significant is the impact on the oil market.",476

In this new report, we take a look at the competitive dynamics between fossil fuels and renewables and question whether renewables will remain competitive in a lower-for-longer fossil fuel environment, and subsequently, can renewables still be competitive in a zero subsidy environment. Financial innovation will be key to making this a reality.Technological breakthroughs in oil and gas production (shale technology) as well as renewable technology have led to precipitous cost declines in both energy mediums. With incremental efficiency gains and cost declines tailing off as renewables technologies mature and given financial costs are a large part of the overall costs for renewable power plants, the authors believe financial innovation could provide the next leg of cost declines for renewables to maintain their competitive position with fossil fuels. Given that cost of capital differs greatly between regions, financing costs of capital intensive renewables projects can indeed constitute the close to half of overall costs.To investigate how innovations in renewable energy finance and policy support for green finance could alter competitive dynamics of renewables vs. fossil fuels, the report considers total costs of new power plants forecasted to 2030 under a ‘high’ and ‘low’ financing scenario and finds that financing costs matter.Equally important as renewables to global climate change mitigation are the dynamics of inter-fuel competition and namely the battle between coal and gas. While new plant economics seem to favor the rise of natural gas, regional variation in costs and power demand growth could dampen its ascent, to the benefit of coal.",497
109,"There is therefore a need for governments to assess appropriate policies to assure not only support for renewables but also for natural gas. In a changing energy environment, the issue of stranded assets is relevant as there is fear that policies aimed at climate change could lead to large amounts of stranded assets and potentially creating the inadvertent effect of companies holding back on needed investments to fuel the planet.Most importantly, the report investigates the future of new energy financing by exploring the core alternative energy project finance strategies that are critically important in many regions.",103

Energy Darwinism II- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesVideo17 Aug 2015Energy Darwinism IIWhy a Low Carbon Future Doesn’t Have to Cost the EarthCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadAs Thomas Edison presciently pointed out to Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone in 1931, “We are like tenant farmers chopping down the fence around our house for fuel when we should be using nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy - sun, wind and tide. I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.”While fossil reserves aren’t running out, our ability to burn them without limit may be, due to the fact that atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and equivalents are rapidly approaching the so-called 'carbon budget' – the level that if we go beyond is likely to lead to global warming in excess of the important 2 degrees Celsius level.It is this that makes the United Nations COP21 meeting in Paris in December 2015 so important; it represents the first real opportunity to reach a legally binding agreement to tackle emissions, given that all parties, including the big emitters, are coming to the table with positive intentions, against a backdrop of an improving global economy.We live though in an energy hungry world. Global GDP is set to treble by 2060, with two thirds of that growth coming from emerging markets which display significantly greater energy and carbon intensity per unit of GDP than developed markets. Feeding that energy demand and facilitating growth while minimizing emissions will take brave and coordinated decisions on the part of policymakers.In this report, we examine the likely costs of inaction in terms of the potential liabilities from climate change to see whether we can afford not to act. We also examine whether the world can afford to act, by comparing the incremental costs of following a low carbon path to global GDP. Overall, we find that the incremental costs of action are limited (and indeed ultimately lead to savings), offer reasonable returns on investment, and should not have too detrimental an effect on global growth. Nevertheless, our energy choices will have a profound impact on countries, industries and companies, and we examine the implications of a low carbon future in terms of the stranded assets that are likely to result.",497
111,"Finally, we examine the solutions that financial markets and institutions can offer to facilitate this transition to a lower carbon world.We are not climate scientists, nor are we trying to take sides in the global warming debate, rather we are trying to take an objective look at the economics of the discussion, to assess the incremental costs and impacts of mitigating the effects of emissions, to see if there is a 'solution' which offers global opportunities without penalizing global growth, whether we can afford it (or indeed we can afford not to), and how we could make it happen.We believe that that solution does exist. The incremental costs of following a low carbon path are in context limited and seem affordable, the 'return' on that investment is acceptable and moreover the likely avoided liabilities are enormous. Given that all things being equal cleaner air has to be preferable to pollution, a very strong ""Why would you not?"" argument begins to develop.With the global economy improving post-crisis, interest rates low, the large emitters coming to the table, investment capital keen, and public opinion broadly supportive, Paris offers a generational opportunity; one that we believe should be firmly grasped with both hands.Authors: Jason Channell,Elizabeth Curmi, PhD.,Phuc Nguyen,Elaine Prior,Alastair R Syme,Heath R Jansen,Ebrahim Rahbari,Edward L Morse,Seth M Kleinman,Tim Kruger,Click here to view the report in full.EnergySri SeriesUP NEXTArticleEnergy Darwinism IIICiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleRethinking Single-Use PlasticsCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoEnergy 2030: Financing A Greener FutureCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",402

The only time we thought about the weather was when it rained and we couldn’t go to the beach or when it warmed up and we were threatened with falling through the ice. But things are different now. Concerns about the weather aren’t just about our activity schedules; they are now mixed with a growing awareness around climate change and the effects of global warming. While we snuck away from school to get some extra time at the lake, kids are now using their stolen time to demonstrate for climate change awareness in hopes they can stop the planet being damaged by rising temperatures.If scientists are right, and we’re moving down a path in which rising average temperatures could lead to huge changes in our ecosystem, it would make sense to at least have a plan to mitigate the danger. And unfortunately this isn’t tomorrow’s problem — at current rates of carbon emissions we could hit the ‘carbon budget’ in 10 to 15 years. At that point, we would have to stop producing carbon emissions or risk major issues such as drought and rising sea levels. But where do we start? Well first, let’s look at what we’re doing now and how that’s affecting climate change. Then we should look at what the future would look like if we keep doing the same old same old. Now, let’s see what happens if we tweak a few things. What can we change today that will have a positive effect in the future, i.e. what’s the sensitivity of our actions today on future climate change?To do this we introduce Citi’s Global Integrated Energy & Emissions Framework, which assesses current energy usage and carbon (CO2) emissions around the world by fuel, by industry, and by country.",451
113,"The framework poses a bunch of ‘what if’ scenarios, such as what happens to CO2 emissions if we increase renewables penetration to 70% in the U.S., or if China switches to all electric vehicles by 2050? The results are sometimes surprising as at times changes we thought would have had the most meaningful effect are more than offset by knock-on effects elsewhere.A few solid observations emerge across the scenarios: (1) Transportation remains a key challenge and despite aggressive assumptions in some scenarios regarding electric vehicle (EV) penetration, the legacy effect of old vehicle fleets remains high. Solutions include incentivizing EV uptake and speeding the removal of legacy fleets; (2) Freight and aviation emissions grow or remain high long into the future. Here new technologies like hydrogen trucking and new fuel mixes need to emerge; (3) Industry’s use of fossil fuels for both heat and motion remains high. Increasing industrial energy efficiency as well as mass electrification of industry are key to reducing emissions; and (4) Fossil fuel use is significant in buildings for both heat and cooking, and energy-efficient measures need to be introduced.With massive electrification a key solution for many emission issues, moving power generation away from fossil fuels and towards clean power is crucial. Technologies already exist to make this happen but the rise of energy storage will be the tipping point for adoption and the potential offered by new business models.Here’s to hoping the future will be more about what we can do in the weather rather than what the weather will do.Authors: Jason Channell,Elizabeth Curmi,Ying Qin,Alastair R Syme,Kate O’Sullivan,Ryan O’Sullivan,Gabriel M Adler,Raghav Gupta-Chaudhary,Zoe Whitton,Ephrem Ravi,Click here to view the report in full.CarbonClimate ChangeElectrificationEmissionsEnergySri SeriesSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",431

The emergence of shale gas has transformed the U.S. energy market while Germany has seen some gas-fired power stations running for less than 10 days a year due to the impact of solar leading utility owners to issue profit warnings. Developed markets now spend more on renewable capital expenditures than they do on conventional generation, largely due to uncertainty over commodity pricing and likely future utilisation rates, while the legacy of Fukushima has seen Japan burning gas at $16-17/mmbtu while the U.S. basks in $3 shale, driving the introduction of the world’s most attractive solar subsidy scheme and catapulting Japan to be the world’s second largest solar market. Conversely, the intermittency of renewables has led to the greater demand for the flexibility of gas-fired power plants in some markets.So, fuel and technology substitution is happening – and not just in developed markets. The shift in emerging markets is less marked, but is nonetheless there. The voracious appetite for power displayed by emerging markets will engender a higher level of new conventional generation (in particular coal), though gas is gradually taking demand from coal and renewables are forecast to represent 10% of new installed power generation capacity in China over the next two years. Despite these shifts, the analysis of individual fuel and technology cost curves – a key determinant in setting the market price – has continued largely on a standalone basis, with limited emphasis on the risks of substitution. Accordingly, in this report we have combined the work of our alternative energy oil & gas, mining (coal), utility and commodity research teams to create an integrated energy cost curve, which allows us to assess the impact and risks of this substitutional change across all fuel and technology types. Importantly, this integrated curve looks at incremental energy demand and supply, meaning relatively small changes in the mix can have a material impact on the returns of projects, particularly those at the upper end of the cost curve.",465

Commitments made under the Paris Agreement in 2015 were an important first step in addressing climate issues, but now it was time to turn promises into global action and recommit to tackling the climate crisis. At the same time, concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic were fading, economies were recovering, and there was a general feeling things were getting back to “business as usual.” By all accounts, COP26 was a success as ambitious targets were agreed to on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and funding climate action for developing countries. Consensus was forming around the idea that net-zero carbon could be achieved by 2050. And financing mechanisms were being put in place by developed countries to honor their $100 billion commitment to developing nations to help fund the Energy Transition.And just as it felt like things were going back to “business as usual,” the Omicron variant of COVID-19 took hold and the Russia-Ukraine conflict erupted. Suddenly we were spilling into a world of rising inflation, supply constraints in fuel and food, and a deteriorating political backdrop. Combined, these headwinds threatened to derail the push for decarbonization as governments focused on energy security and short-term economic issues.On the regulation side, three major economies — the U.S., the EU, and China — have taken action to significantly accelerate the Energy Transition: (1) The U.S. passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022 with $369 billion in investment earmarked for energy security and climate change sectors; (2) the EU’s REPowerEU plan, unveiled in May 2022, forced an upgrade to its already ambitious Energy Transition goals from the prior “Fit-for-55” package; and (3) China reiterated its commitment to see peak CO2 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2060.Technology and innovation in energy storage systems; carbon capture, utilization, and storage; and alternative energy such as biofuels/sustainable aviation fuel, nuclear, and hydrogen, will drive energy security and independence.",495
116,"On the financial side, carbon pricing schemes and carbon credits for hard-to-abate sectors can help internalize the cost of pollution, thus giving an economic incentive to switch to more sustainable approaches. More importantly, multilateral development banks, and supranational institutions can step up to create blended finance at scale, can facilitate the Energy Transition in areas of the world that need it most.Given the scale of the issue, we have published Energy Transition in two volumes. Volume I — Mixed Momentum on the Path to Net Zero — looks at (1) where we are on the commitments agreed to last year at COP26 given recent geopolitical and climate events, and (2) what needs to be done to keep momentum on track in the Energy Transition. Volume II — Building Bridges to Renew Momentum — focuses on the funding requirements and tools required to ensure a successful Energy Transition.Authors: Momentum Stalled in 2022A deteriorating economic and political backdrop in 2022 has slowed the process of decarbonization as the focus turns to one of energy security and short-term economic issues. Sustainable Financing Is Also Slowing Momentum in the Energy Transition was building ahead of the COP26 meeting in November 2021. Sustainable debt issuance (including for social and other areas not directly part of the Energy Transition) increased from $320 billion to $1.7 trillion from 2018 through 2021. However, momentum in 2022 has slowed, with volumes reaching just $740 billion in the first half of 2022, a 16.8% year-over-year decline.Solutions to Accelerate the Energy Transition Despite the slowdown in momentum, recent global events have increased the drive for energy security and independence, and will likely accelerate the uptake path to economic viability of many new and existing technologies, as well as innovative financial solutions.Fiscal Stimulus Required for Renewable Energy Supply and InfrastructureAccording to the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the total capital investment necessary to achieve a net zero future requires over $275 trillion by 2050. Given the staggering amount of investment capital necessary for the Energy Transition, fiscal stimulus to catalyze commercially viable renewable energy supply and infrastructure is essential.Subscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",494

Feeding the Future- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesArticle19 Nov 2018Feeding the FutureHow Innovation and Shifting Consumer Preferences Can Help Feed a Growing PlanetCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsShareDownloadIt’s a simple question: Will we be able to feed everyone if the population of the planet rises from about 7 billion people today to 9-10 billion in 2050? If you are a student of Thomas Malthus and buy into his Essay on the Principles of Population, then you believe this type of population increase will result in famine and poverty. The good news is that when Malthus published his famous paper in 1798 the global population was only 800 million and despite an almost nine-fold increase in population, his predictions luckily have not been realized.Advances in agriculture, food manufacturing, and food distribution together have increased the efficiency of the global food industry to supply an ever-growing population. But if we look at today’s global food industry, we find that it is unsustainable for future demand in its current format. For the industry to keep up with a 60-70% increase in food demand over the next 30 years, it can’t continue to operate in a ‘business as usual’ mode.What’s wrong? Three main issues plague the global food industry: sustainability, waste, and nutrition. On the sustainability front, agriculture today consumes 70% of surface and groundwater and uses 50% of habitable land while the entire food industry is responsible for up to one-third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, around 1.3 billion tonnes of food — almost one-third of all food produced — gets lost or wasted every year. Malnutrition — in the form of hunger and undernourishment, obesity or micronutrient deficiencies —affects almost 40% of the global population and the impacts on public health and economic development now cost the global economy almost $3.5 trillion per year.Is there a simple answer? No, not simple. But the first step towards a solution is to understand the problem ahead of us — identify the need for more sustainable agriculture, more efficient manufacturing and distribution, and consistent delivery of nutritious food.In the report that follows, we look at ways the industry can use innovation and technology to become more sustainable.",490
119,"In farming, using big data and digital agriculture such as the use of sensors, field monitoring, and aerial imaging as well as new technology in farm equipment and aeroponics can increase sustainability and decrease the amount of land required for food production. New seed technology, feed additives, alternative proteins and biofortification also help increase nutrition. Expanding agriculture in the Southern Hemisphere is also an opportunity as improving yield gaps leads to better sustainability.On the consumer front, a shift towards health and wellness is driving food manufacturers to alter their portfolios to deliver more nutritious, indulgent, safe, and sustainable products. Consumers are also changing the way they shop for food and are becoming more conscious of where their food comes from, leading to increased supply-chain transparency.Can we get there? We think so, but it will require (1) easier access to financing; (2) the removal of distortions in the agriculture and food market; (3) vertical integration across the supply chain; (4) easier and faster access to the market for innovation and technology; (5) better data and information; and (6) better healthier products and a change in diets to continue to prove Malthus wrong.Authors: Authors: Elizabeth Curmi,Aakash Doshi,Gregory R Badishkanian,Nick Coulter,David Driscoll, CFA,P.J.

Food and Climate ChangeOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesArticle19 Jul 2022Food and Climate ChangeCreating Sustainable Food Systems for a Net Zero FutureCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadExecutive SummaryWhat comes to mind in a discussion about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions? A dirty factory smokestack spewing out brown smoke or a car idling in traffic on a highway pumping out exhaust fumes? Looking through media articles on the effects of GHG emissions on climate change, the associated images are typically of cars, buses, and factories polluting the environment. These images link the use of fossil fuels with activities that endanger the environment. From a public policy standpoint, mitigation measures for emissions also focus on fossil fuels. Government actions to reduce climate footprints focus on renewable energy to replace coal and gas-powered electricity generation and electric vehicles to replace internal combustion engines.   Only occasionally, it seems, the focus strays from fossil fuels to methane emissions from cows. But images of green farmland are not what comes to mind when thinking about harmful emissions. Unfortunately, the global food system— agriculture and food production collectively — is responsible for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. This means a global solution to climate change must also address how the world produces and distributes food to its population. As the population of the world and the demand for food increase, the need to find solutions for mitigating emissions from the global food system becomes even more important. The two largest sources of emissions from the global food sector are from deforestation, particularly land clearing for crop production or pasture for cattle farming, which release carbon dioxide; and enteric fermentation, which emits methane during the production of meat. Emissions are also found through the full food supply chain, including in processing, transportation, and household consumption. SOLUTIONS FOR MITIGATING EMISSIONS Given the complexity of the global food ecosystem — not just in overall size of the system but in the number of players — there is no single solution to reducing emissions. In the report that follows, we look at six potential solutions to this challenge. These include (1) regenerative agriculture, (2) low carbon livestock, (3) halting deforestation, (4) reducing food waste, (5) investing in low carbon technology to decarbonize energy-related emissions, and (6) investing in innovation.",497

Food security is typically caused by three main factors: environmental disaster, conflict, and social, political, or economic shifts. In 2022, we find ourselves in a perfect storm of all three. While some of these factors may be alleviated in 2023, their effects will take time to work through. We examine the potential solutions to alleviate current food insecurity and prevent or lessen the severity of future occurrences, looking at four categories: social, technological , public sector, and financial/economic solutions.

How is that possible in a modern society? While we are having high-level debates about the possible dystopian effects on society from advanced technology, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing, we seem to be missing a simple and embarrassing truth — we have failed in our moral responsibility to ensure no one goes hungry. It is easy to write off our current situation by pointing to a slew of one-off events that came together to create a “perfect storm” — droughts, armed conflict, skyrocketing inflation, supply chain issues. But even accounting for this tumultuous year, nearly a billion people around the world, some far away and some literally next door, have gone without food and experienced hunger for at least one day in 2022.Food insecurity has serious social and geopolitical implications and throughout history has been a driver of civil unrest and migration. It also carries a hefty price tag — the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates the costs of malnutrition to the global economy to be as high as $3.5 trillion per year. And while finding a solution will also be costly, the economic benefits to society could reach $10.5 trillion per year.In the report that follows, we first look at what is driving the recent increase in food insecurity and find that although the Russia-Ukraine conflict fanned the flames of the crisis, it was not the sole cause. Environmental factors such as more frequent extreme weather events are making crop production more volatile and increasing the vulnerability of the agriculture sector. Higher energy prices have raised the cost of food production. Rising inflation has forced families to make trade-offs between food and other monthly expenses. And conflict in general has caused disruptions to supply chains and transportation hubs.Although some of these issues will fix themselves in 2023, there is a scenario where higher-than-normal agriculture prices persist with continued high fertilizer prices.",465
126,"The recent increase in protectionist trade policies, including export bans, is also exacerbating the problem.So how do we fix this? How do we ensure we are making out best effort to reduce the number of hungry people? The proposed solutions can be bucketed into four categories: social, technological, economic/financial, and governmental. Society can make small changes to eliminate food waste or shifting to a more plant-based diet, which would increase the amount of available food. Technological innovation in alternative proteins and indoor farming as well as automation and robotics can help in ensure food self-sufficiency for regions reliant on imports and improve the food ecosystem.Financing vehicles such as blended finance and hedging facilities can help facilitate investment in infrastructure. And government is needed to help push the agenda forward with targeted policy and regulation as well as provide humanitarian aid and sustained investment in global agriculture.Big problems take big solutions and big efforts.   Authors: Jason Channell,Ying Qin,Elizabeth Curmi,Adam Bergman,Aakash Doshi,John B Finnigan,Emma Hampton,Dustin Oliver Ling,Julie Monaco,Harlin Singh Urofsky,Georgi Yordanov,No Room for ComplacencyAround the globe, nearly a third of us worry about where our next meal is coming from, and one in ten of us suffer from hunger or malnutrition. How is that possible in a modern society? While we are having high-level debates about the possible dystopian effects on society from advanced technology, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing, we seem to be missing a simple and embarrassing truth — we have failed in our moral responsibility to ensure no one goes hungry.A Perfect StormA perfect storm of conflict, environmental, and social, political, and economic shifts is worsening global food insecurity. The Russia-Ukraine conflict highlighted the risk of depending on too few countries for food and on physical chokepoints for the transport of key commodities. While some effects may be alleviated in 2023, food prices may remain elevated for some time, even if further inflation looks less likely.Global ImplicationsWhile this is, first and foremost, an immediate human tragedy, the economic and social/geopolitical implications of food insecurity have material macroeconomic impacts. Disruptions in food production have employment consequences while the economic impact from malnutrition could be as high as $3.5 trillion per year. In particular, history suggests high food prices can lead to civil unrest and displacement, e.g., the Arab Spring in 2011.",501

Food, Water, and Climate ChangeOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesArticle29 Nov 2023Food, Water, and Climate ChangeSolutions for Tackling this Critical NexusCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsShareDownload ReportWe take things for granted every day. In the morning it’s easy to take the coffee cart on the sidewalk outside the office for granted, despite it allowing us to start day with a warm cup of caffeine and a buttered roll. At 7a.m. there are likely few thoughts around the logistics necessary for the cart to be fully stocked and in the right location each morning, let alone the details around where the flour and coffee beans were grown. Being able to easily get breakfast is all the matters. In the Citi GPS Sustainability series, we have written extensively about climate change. Specifically, in Food and Climate Change: Creating Sustainable Food Systems for a Net Zero Future, we discussed the impact of food production on greenhouse gas emissions, and in Food Security: Tackling the Current Crisis and Building Future Resilience, we explored how climate change can heighten the ever-present global threat of food insecurity. But the big issue we may be overlooking is the relationship between food, water, and climate change. What happens if changes in climate affect the availability of water resources? And with water already stressed in many regions, could climate change lead to pressures on food production? In our new report, we investigate the connections between water, food, and climate change — known as the water, food, and climate nexus — with particular attention given to the impacts that too much or too little water could have on food production. Staple crops — rice, wheat, maize (corn), and soybeans — make up around two-thirds of the world’s food calories, making them critically important to consumers worldwide. Global production of these staple crops is highly concentrated in regions known as “breadbaskets,” and at least 72% of the global production of each of these crops is found in just five regions. Any changes to the growing conditions in these regions would have huge global consequences. In our analysis, we looked at the water stress levels in these five regions and found that in a “business-as-usual” climate change scenario, many countries have an extremely high risk of water stress in 2050.",486
128,"India is of particular concern, with over 70% of rice and 78% of wheat currently produced in areas that could have high-to-significant water stress in 2050. We then looked at the materiality of staple food production in each country, including whether the country is a large producer or exporter of these staple crops and the size of the country’s population. We found that a failure, or even a reduction, in crop yields in any of these countries would have a material impact on global food security, with cereal prices rising by 1% to 28% and an additional 1 million to 180 million people potentially going hungry. Moreover, nearly $3 trillion of business revenues of publicly listed companies could be affected. The good news is there are plenty of technological solutions that can help us avoid this dismal scenario, but good governance will also be important. We explore these opportunities in the report. The food, water, climate change nexus is critical and should not be taken for granted.  Food Insecurity, Water, and Climate ChangeAgricultural production is highly susceptible to changes in climate. It is also reliant on the availability of water resources, which are already stressed in many regions important for food production. These water pressure will increase with climate chnage. Food Production At RiskWe analyzed crop-producing regions in key ""breadbaskets"" and found that large portions of food production occur in areas forecast to face varying levels of water stress risk due to climate change. Including all levels of water stress, we also assign a ""materiality"" rating to assess the impact of global food security from a decline in a region's food production.",333
129,"global insights citigps g 20s financial inclusion killer app. The G-20'S Financial Inclusion Killer App - A Citi GPS OpinionOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle20 Apr 2012The G-20’s Financial Inclusion Killer AppCiti GPS Opinion ArticleCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsContributor(s):  Jay CollinsShareThe mobile phone has the power to economically transform the lives of 2 billion of the world’s poorest people. For those without bank accounts, who are excluded from the basic workings of modern financial activity, the ability to move, pay, collect and store money on mobile devices represents a first time opportunity to actually participate in the financial economy. However, successful mobile financial ecosystems require a critical mass of participants in order to reach a tipping point where they can have broad-based inclusive and sustainable impact. The recent Citi GPS report, Upwardly Mobile: An Analysis of the Global Payments Opportunity, concluded that the Mobile Payments opportunity has two facets – the developed market opportunity which is to provide a secure, feature-rich product for smartphone users, and an emerging market opportunity where financial inclusion is the initial use-case driver. At this weekend’s Spring IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington, the G-20 should embrace mobile money as the killer app of economic developmental policy. If mobile money is to reach its potential, governments must seize the opportunity with bold leadership, proactive regulation and flow contributions in order to facilitate the functioning of mobile ecosystems. The G-20, through its Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI), can make an enormous difference by more fully embracing the power of mobile money and playing a more active role in driving mobile money’s adoption. Mobile money’s benefits are potentially far reaching. India’s mobile finance 2020 estimates are perhaps the most informative and inspirational, with a potential GDP increase of 5%, tax revenue growth of $50 billion and 4 million new jobs – 1 of every ten new jobs created, according to Boston Consulting Group. That represents a potential 600,000 new businesses before 2020. As the G-20 analyzes global job creation policy alternatives, mobile finance should be on the list. For example, credit-starved small and medium enterprises (SME) contribute 45% of total developing world employment, and mobile finance can materially improve credit flows to SMEs, thereby moving the employment needle. Mobile ecosystems will require intensive coordination and collaboration among many participants.",499
130,"The perfect world mobile finance ecosystem would sound like a symphony orchestra, where the various industry and government participants show up at the same time, with the same sheet of music and play in harmony. That is not today’s reality. Currently, players appear at different times and places with their own music and tempo. Here is where governments must step in. Without facilitation and participation by governments in ensuring that the rules are clear as well as consistently applied across market participants and jurisdictions, and by committing to do their part to contribute flows, many mobile ecosystems could stall, or fail completely. Policy coordination must be improved or the private sector will not have the confidence to build and invest, nor be able to do so within an accelerated time horizon. One of the immediate policy challenges is how best to regulate this new ecosystem. While setting up regulatory frameworks for mobile money can be difficult to get right, many emerging market governments are moving toward a proportionate legal and regulatory framework. Using the principle of proportionality, countries are matching the relative risk (i.e. small transactions, limited balances) to the regulatory and legal requirements. Countries are creating new frameworks to ensure that citizens can enter the mobile money world while still maintaining high levels of control over such issues as anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) standards. Beyond regulation, most governments still underestimate how important they are in the acceleration process of developing world mobile ecosystem success. For example, paying government salaries, social benefits and pensions into the mobile channel could speed adoption and move the ecosystem dramatically forward along the network effect curve. Government fund flows will expand impact and reach, encourage others to participate and most likely result in acceleration of the financial product surge beyond payments. Flows from international official donors and NGOs can also make an enormous difference. Reciprocally, mobile payments provide governments and international donors with greater transparency, insight and influence over the disbursement and usage of payments. Once an individual receives a payment that puts cash into his mobile wallet, it is critical that the mobile ecosystem enable him to use this money to make payments, or the ecosystem won’t balance and the individual will simply have to “cash-out”. Two of the most important outflows of the socially excluded segment are electricity and water payments, often made to public utilities by the unbanked in the form of cash. Governments should collect these payments via mobile phone.",478
131,"In addition, having the ability to use a mobile wallet to purchase food and household goods from a local retail store will ultimately be critical in driving adoption by the poor and reducing the amount of “cash-out”. In order for unbanked individuals to be able to pay using a mobile wallet, small retail owners must have a mobile wallet themselves. Here is where fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies come in to play. FMCG truck drivers that accept cash upon delivery should encourage retailers to pay via mobile. This would exponentially increase the number of retail locations that have a mobile wallet and that are able to accept a mobile payment from the unbanked citizen to purchase basic goods, representing a financial inclusion policy coup. Finally, financial education has become a core part of the G-20’s focus on financial inclusion. Going forward, one of the most important ways that governments can contribute to the functioning of mobile finance ecosystems is to support financial education. Governments and NGOs should combine efforts on a more consistent basis so that education includes not just how mobile wallets works, but also the advantages it brings to the unbanked. Financial inclusion and the role of government in driving mobile financial adoption in the developing world ought to be a priority for this year’s Mexican G-20 leadership and firmly on the agenda this weekend in Washington. Unlike so many of the areas on the G-20’s plate, mobile finance will not further strain government budgets nor create rifts among members. Ultimately, pushing the G-20 and GPFI deeper into the mobile finance agenda will produce commonality of purpose, further include other developing economies in a collaborative pro-growth process, and drive financial inclusion. This can make it a sure win for Mexico’s G-20 leadership and the world.Authors: Jay Collins,Authors: Jay Collins,Authors: Jay Collins,Authors: Jay Collins, DisruptionGPS OpinionMobile PaymentsUP NEXTArticleUpwardly Mobile IIICiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleUpwardly Mobile IICiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoUpwardly MobileCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",470

But while we might all be aware of the big picture, the rise of “net zero,” and the many climate acronyms popping up daily, do we really know where we are now, what the current plans in place — if delivered upon — would achieve, and what the plan to get to net zero actually is?For most people the answer is a resounding, “No.” Sadly, ignorance is not bliss in this situation; the reality is we still have a mountain to climb and we are lacking much of the equipment needed to scale it.While the COP21 in Paris six years ago is recognized by most as a resounding success, progress to the agreed upon conference goals, at least from individual nations, has failed to live up to promise — both in terms of actions to date and future intentions. If we add up all of the current NDCs (national determined contributions — essentially each country’s individual plan to stay within a 1.5 degree Celsius world — the aggregate effect in 2030 would be for emissions of around 55 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). This represents an emissions reduction of just 1% versus 2019 and a 9% increase since 2010 if the conditional elements of NDCs are included. However, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tells us that in order to meet their 1.5 degree Celsius scenario, emissions by 2030 would need to fall by 45% versus 2010 levels. So current efforts are not even reducing emissions, let alone heading towards net zero.",420
134,"Looking at it in a different way, the Paris scenario would all but use up the entire “carbon budget” (the amount we can emit before temperatures rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius) by 2030, meaning that even to stand a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees Celsius, our emissions would then have to magically drop to zero — which is clearly a fantasy.What is going on? If we all know about climate change, and 191 countries have signed up to the Paris Agreement to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, how is it possible that emissions in 2030, even with each country’s “efforts,” will barely change? The simple answer is, “growth.” While emissions have fallen and continue to fall in many developed markets, emissions from developing markets continue to grow significantly. This is for a variety of reasons. Economic development brings greater levels of wealth and demand for autos, white goods, holidays etc. In addition, the pace of growth, in countries where resources are limited, often means going for the fastest and cheapest upfront forms of energy, which are often carbon intensive — even if low-carbon alternatives might be cheaper in the long run.Does this mean our current situation is all the fault of emerging markets? Not really. Emissions per capita are significantly higher in developed markets, and moreover, the vast majority of the carbon budget has been used up historically by developed nations, in particular the EU and the U.S. Therefore, while current emissions and future growth might be all down to emerging markets, it is very much the fault of developed markets that we are where we are. So, do developed nations have the moral right to tell emerging markets they cannot be afforded the same leeway in economic development which developed markets had historically? And by doing that, can they effectively consign large swaths of the population to slower economic development, and at the extremes, consign millions to poverty for many years longer than might otherwise be the case?Simply put, to stand any chance of staying within a 1.5-degree Celsius temperature increase, we need to do much, much more to reduce emissions. Moreover, we cannot realistically expect emerging markets to fund their own decarbonization programs, and slow their economic growth and the prospects of their (voting) populaces themselves. The global burden must fall at least in part on developed nations.",483
135,"This would be a tough sell at the best of times, let alone in a massively indebted post-COVID-19 world. Convincing developed market voters they need to subsidize emerging markets — enabling them to compete better with developed markets in the future, with all of the implications for employment and economic growth it entails — will be difficult.We need to find a mechanism whereby global efforts to decarbonize are funded efficiently and equitably. This is where COP26 can help, and in particular “Article 6,” which looks at ways in which countries can work together — either bilaterally, regionally, or indeed globally — to reduce overall emissions.The world is a mess when it comes to carbon regimes — there are currently 64 carbon pricing systems globally, with another 30+ in development. Thirty of the existing systems are carbon markets, with the remaining 34 carbon tax regimes. Not only is there no agreement on a mechanism, but the prices within these regimes vary from the meaningless $0.10/tonne to an eye-watering $142.40/tonne — against a price widely seen as necessary now for Paris-alignment of $40-$80/tonne. This fragmented approach is clearly inefficient, and evidence tells us that so far, it is proving ineffective at a global level. Accordingly, to achieve real progress, we must find some way of integrating these individual regimes into one globally-fungible system. There are essentially four ways we could achieve this, using one, or a combination, of the methods mentioned below:The first option is essentially via command and control directives, where governments/regulators simply mandate the amount of emissions that are allowed when and from which industries, with non-compliance penalized severely. While potentially effective, this is unlikely to be efficient, and almost certainly would not provide the lowest cost solution. This leads us to the three other, market-based solutions (which, it should be pointed out, are not mutually exclusive): The first of these is a carbon tax on emissions, which could either be applied as a flat rate globally, or with differing rates for emerging and developed markets, potentially with differing ratcheting up speeds, to eventually bring the world into alignment.  The second option involves cap and trade systems, whereby allowances for emissions are granted and/or auctioned up to a (reducing) limit, with parties showing faster than prescribed progress allowed to sell their excess allowances to other slower moving parties — while still reaching the same cap.",501
136," The third option involves baseline and credit systems, whereby parties earn credits for reducing emissions, which could be sold to others in deficit, potentially within one of the two preceding mechanisms. Each of these is fraught with complexities, both technical, and perhaps more importantly, political. Discussion of the pros and cons of each of these methods, the pitfalls and stumbling blocks, as well as how they might be implemented, forms the basis of this report.There are essentially two key problems common to all of the four methods — who pays for decarbonization, and assuming we successfully raise the money, how, and most importantly where, does the money get spent/distributed?Bottom line, as already noted above, there will need to be some transfer of value from developed markets to emerging markets. Putting a price on carbon has the potential to drive the adoption of CBAMs (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms), essentially taxing carbon-intensive imports that are not subject to an equivalent carbon regime in line with that of the importing country/bloc. Countries that either do not take action, or do not do so at the “required” rate, could potentially see themselves become international pariahs, in both political and economic/trade terms. As the Citi Global Insights Sustainable Finance team points out in a recent report, cross-border carbon has the potential to become one the biggest factors in global trade over the coming years and decades. The problem, is that a large proportion of carbon-intensive manufacturing is carried out in emerging markets, and hence CBAMs could actually cause money to flow in the opposite direction to that which we are trying to achieve — even if they might encourage other countries to decarbonize faster (to avoid taxes being applied to their exports).The second issue of how to allocate revenues is also a thorny one. Should revenue raised from, for example, carbon taxes remain in the country where it is raised, helping the less fortunate to cover the inevitably higher cost of goods that will result? Undoubtedly some should, but the reality is that for many emerging markets, a carbon tax could represent a crippling sum — in some cases as much as 20% of GDP. The impact of this on growth could be so dramatic as to make it unfeasible, and hence the need for capital flows from developed markets. One novel idea, which we propose in this report, is the creation of a climate development bank along the lines of existing development finance institutions.",487
137,"The bank would be funded collectively by nations and could take some/all of the receipts from global regimes and reallocate them around the world into lower carbon development. While not without issues, this would at least provide a coordinated and specialized approach, and would also present an enormous opportunity to harness the trillions of dollars of private capital that wants to invest sustainably, by adopting a blended finance approach.In summary, if we really are serious about tackling climate change and avoiding the resulting economic, social, and environmental decimation, we need to do much, much more, and we need to start working with each other to achieve our shared goals. There are no easy solutions, either economically or politically. However, we should not see these solutions as a cost. If approached correctly, the significant economic multiplier effects — even before we start to consider the environment and social multiplier effects — are compelling on their own. However, politics being politics, reaching a universal agreement in Glasgow will be tough, and hence it may be that the most likely outcome is the formation of so-called climate clubs — for example the U.S. and EU acting in concert and applying CBAMs to third-party countries that are not willing to pick up the baton (or move fast enough) to ultimately encourage a similar level of ambition.Whatever the outcome of COP26 in Glasgow, a mountain lies before us that absolutely must be climbed — by all of us, collectively. If we are successful, the view at the top looking forward would be spectacular, and who knows, could even usher in an era of greater global cooperation. If we fail to climb it by choice though, rising temperatures and sea levels might push us up that slope unwillingly, by which time it would be too late to turn back the clock. Either way, we are going up that slope, and we might as well do it on our terms now, in the cheapest way possible, and have the option to return down the mountain again when it is safe — rather than being stuck up that mountain, remembering what the world used to be like.Authors: Elizabeth Curmi,Jason Channell,Ying Qin,Edward L Morse,Eric G Lee,Anthony Yuen,Francesco Martoccia,Igor Cesarec,Adam Phillips,We Are Running Out of TimeHuman-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) have already caused one degree of global warming.",478
138,"In 2018, cumulative CO2 emissions exceeded 1.6 trillion tonnes, with the U.S> and EU27 responsible for the greatest share. China is responsible for 24% of total annual emissions, followed by the U.S. at 12%. Importantly, at current emissions rates, we have just 14 years before global temperatures rise beyond 1.5C. This means the time is now to (1) limit GHG emissions, (2) reach at least net zero CO2 emissions, and (3) look to go net negative in the second half of the century.Announced National Determined Commitments (NDCs) Are Not Enough to Limit Temperature Increase of 1.5C or even 2CAccording to the IPCC, by 2030 we need to reduce our GHG emissions by 45% from 2010 levels and reach net zero by 2050. Assuming just the unconditional parts of the announced NDCs are met, projections in 2030 would be 16% higher than 2010 levels. In the context of the carbon budget consistent with a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to just 1.5C, cumulative CO2 emissions in 2020-30, based on the latest NDCs, would use up almost 89% of the remaining carbon budget, leaving just 55 GtCO2 to be used post 2030.Market-Based Mechanisms to Reduce EmissionsA global solution is required to get to a net zero world, which is especially difficult given most market-based mechanisms require global agreement to be effective. Agreeing a solution between two or more nations — a ""climate club"" — could be the solution. Whichever mechanism is used, a new ""Climate Action Development Bank"" would be needed to drive global investments and help de-risk projects, particularly in emerging markets. How a Climate Change Club Could WorkRevenue from the Climate Change Club would be generated from (1) a domestic tax on GHG emissions, and (2) a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) on carbon-intensive imports from countries which are not members of the club. Using a hypothetical club between the U.S.",446

Inequality and Prosperity in the Industrialized World - Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountInclusive Economic Growth SeriesArticle20 Sep 2017Inequality and Prosperity in the Industrialized WorldAddressing a Growing ChallengeCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadOn average, income inequality within developing economies is very high, particularly in Africa, and higher than in the industrialized world, which creates its own major development challenges. But, in aggregate, global income inequality has declined from the late 1980s, and particularly rapidly from about 2008, as developing economies have, on average, closed some of the gap with industrialized countries. Previously, at least since the early 19th century, global inequality had increased. The driving factors behind this change have included the very real impact of globalization and technology on trade and employment, and also the transition of the formerly Communist bloc in Eastern Europe. In very simple terms, globalization has been a positive force in leveling inter-country inequality over the past 30 years. At the same time, the share of the world’s population estimated to be below the World Bank’s $1.90/day extreme poverty threshold has fallen drastically, from 35% in 1990 to 11% in 2013. Despite a major expansion in world population, the number of people in extreme poverty has fallen dramatically from 1.85 billion to under 800 million.However, within-country inequality in the larger developing countries — the same economies that have enjoyed large income growth and narrowed the differences with rich countries, such as China, India, and Indonesia — has actually increased substantially in recent years. As a result, income inequality within countries now accounts for around a third of global inequality, when it was only one-fifth in 1988. The contribution of inter-country inequality has correspondingly shrunk.Of critical focus to our research, income inequality has increased substantially within many OECD countries over recent decades after a long period of decline. The extent to which income inequality in advanced economies has grown is now widely known, though the relative importance of the range of driving forces producing these trends is less clear, as is their importance to economic growth.",460
141,"Rising inequality is not only a concern from a fairness perspective, in itself and in terms of its impacts on social outcomes such as health, crime, and family structures; it is also now increasingly being seen as a core issue for macroeconomic performance, implicated in the economic crisis and slow recovery from it, and as representing a major threat to long-term growth and prosperity.A range of factors has been identified contributing to the rise in income inequality across OECD countries, including technological change, globalization, changes in labor market institutions, and weakening redistribution via taxes and transfers, as well as specific factors affecting the very top of the income distribution and the distribution of wealth and income arising from this. There remain substantial differences across studies as to the relative contribution of particular elements. What is more surprising, perhaps, is that the search for effective responses is still at an early stage, although recently international organizations such as the OECD and IMF have advanced some broad recommendations to tackle inequality while promoting growth.Against this background, our research program will focus on identifying the impacts of inequality on economic growth potential, social cohesion, and the political process. On the back of this, we shall collaboratively suggest a coherent set of responses that would address rising inequality in a manner that promotes inclusive growth.The Executive Summary of this report summarizes our initial findings and conclusions. Three significant points are worth stressing here. First, it appears increasingly clear to us that if the drivers of inequality are not addressed, then inequality may become an increasing drag on economic growth due to a variety of factors which we assess throughout this report and which we shall investigate further in future research. The drag reflects wasted potential and a skills mismatch within labor forces and also that more unequal societies are less successful at investing productively for the long term. Indeed, we highlight that more unequal countries now seem to be growing less robustly than more equal ones, i.e., growth may be lower and more fragile at higher levels of economic inequality. From an investment perspective, an inequality-driven economic drag could take quite different paths in different countries leading to a consequent impact on longer-term relative asset prices and exchange rates. In other words, and put bluntly, it makes good economic sense to understand and address inequality.Second, economic inequalities are everywhere, which makes addressing the underlying issues with simple policy responses very challenging. We show in this report that inequalities have grown not just between countries but between regions within countries, between generations, between industries, and between firms.",491
142,"In particular, demographic forces, most notably the aging population in the developed markets, are creating a new set of inter-generational inequality challenges that are likely to get worse. Globally, wealth inequality is significantly higher than income inequality. Putting an inter-generational lens on this sharpens the issue. The debate around inequality thus needs to be related to issues such as youth unemployment, social mobility, and pension funding.Third, inequality, as well as the impact of other exacerbating factors such as lower social care budgets and the reduced provision of other government-funded services, is now clearly a critical focus in the mainstream political process and in election campaigns in many countries. In aggregate, it appears that inequality is contributing markedly to declining social trust, the erosion of social cohesion, and the fragmentation of the political process. Inequality will likely be an increasing factor in election outcomes, with social media playing a growing role in shaping perceptions. A consensus urgently needs to be reached between government, the public sector, the private sector, and society at large about how to tackle the challenge of inequality in a way that promotes inclusive and necessary economic growth. At the moment, we risk political paralysis, or worse.Authors: Brian Nolan,Ebrahim Rahbari,Matteo Richiardi,Luis Valenzuela Rivera,Benjamin Nabarro,Authors: Brian Nolan,Ebrahim Rahbari,Matteo Richiardi,Luis Valenzuela Rivera,Benjamin Nabarro,Authors: Authors: Brian Nolan,Ebrahim Rahbari,Matteo Richiardi,Luis Valenzuela Rivera,Benjamin Nabarro,Authors: Brian Nolan,Ebrahim Rahbari,Matteo Richiardi,Luis Valenzuela Rivera,Benjamin Nabarro,Click here to view the report in full.EconomicGrowthInclusive SeriesPoliticalUP NEXTArticleMigration and the EconomyCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleSecuring India's Growth Over the Next DecadeCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoWomen in the EconomyCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",465

Infrastructure for Growth- Citi Global Solutions & PerspectivesOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountInclusive Economic Growth SeriesVideo19 Oct 2016Infrastructure for GrowthThe dawn of a new multi-trillion dollar asset classCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsShareDownloadThroughout history, economic and social development have gone hand in hand with infrastructure development, be it the road networks and sanitation advances of the Romans (what did they do for us?), the Silk Road, or the maritime advances which led to the age of exploration and resulting global trade. Our modern era has been similarly transformed by the availability of energy, electronic communications, and modern travel which have made the world a much smaller place.However, the amount which we spend on infrastructure has gradually been falling as a percentage of GDP, and, while there are justifications for this, the stock of infrastructure compared to global GDP has fallen.At the same time, there is an enormous social need for infrastructure investment. Over 1.5 billion people have no access to electricity; just under 1 billion still live without safe drinking water, and over 2.5 billion are without access to basic sanitation. If the UN are right, and we need to accommodate an additional 1.5 billion people in the next 20 years, most of whom will be in emerging markets, and most of them in infrastructure-heavy urban centers, then there will be an ever more pressing need for infrastructure investment.The global economy though seems mired in a period of sluggish growth. With interest rates close to zero, or in some cases negative in real terms, and the bazooka of QE already widely deployed, policymakers are running out of monetary levers to pull. This leaves us with the potential of fiscal stimulus, one aspect of which is infrastructure spending which can boost growth using both short-term demand effects, and longer-term supply effects, with the so-called multiplier effect implying that, if done correctly, the resulting GDP boost is larger than the initial investment.However, developed market governments find themselves with debt at typically 100% of GDP, and hence limited capacity to spend, and, while emerging markets are less indebted at 40%, they are reluctant to boost debt and place sovereign ratings at risk. Traditional sources of infrastructure finance such as banks find themselves constrained by regulations such as Basel III, while insurance companies are constrained by Solvency II. Two factors, however, offer an enormous opportunity for the world.",500
144,"Firstly, governments can borrow at historically low rates (if not for free) for incredibly long durations. Perhaps most importantly, though, and the focus of this report, is the potential offered by private sector investment.Returns on equities and bonds have in recent years been at historic lows, and Investors are crying out for yield, in particular for long-dated, stable cashflows and income streams. Infrastructure assets lend themselves perfectly to this need, with often predictable operating characteristics, and very long, multi-decade, useful lives.Moreover, the scale of the opportunity is vast — we estimate a global need for infrastructure spending of $58.6 trillion over the next 15 years. In this report we examine why now could be the time for a global infrastructure push, and where the most exciting opportunities are by region and industry. Most importantly, though, with a need for infrastructure from a social and economic perspective and with funding keen to participate, we examine why it isn’t happening, and what stakeholders, both government and financial, need to do to make it happen.We are faced with a rare opportunity to create and grow a new asset class, build a better world that is fit for the future, and create millions of jobs in the process; and who knows, we may just kick-start the global economy in the process.Authors: Authors: Jason Channell,Elizabeth Curmi, PhD.,David Lubin,Ebrahim Rahbari,Click here to view the report in full.GlobalInclusive SeriesInfrastructureInvestmentUP NEXTArticleMigration and the EconomyCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleSecuring India's Growth Over the Next DecadeCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleInequality and Prosperity in the Industrialized WorldCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",407
145,"global insights citigps labor market reforms wont solve euro area jobs crisis. Why Labor Market Reforms Won't Solve the Euro Area Jobs Crisis - CitiGPSOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle23 Jul 2013Why Labor Market Reforms Won’t Solve the Euro Area Jobs CrisisCiti GPS Opinion ArticleCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsContributor(s):  Ebrahim RahbariShareThe euro area isn’t working — quite literally. Roughly seven million more people are unemployed in the euro area currently than in 2007 and in recent quarters the number of unemployed persons has been rising by almost half a million per quarter. We believe unemployment is likely to remain high for a long time, despite extensive labor market reforms in the euro area in recent years, particularly in Greece, Spain and Portugal. In order to significantly decrease unemployment, more reform is needed but labor market reforms alone will not solve the euro area job crisis and have little hope of bringing unemployment down quickly. For job creation to take off, growth in aggregate demand is needed as well as structural reforms. Without these changes, persistent high unemployment will raise the risk of austerity fatigue, social unrest and sovereign debt restructuring. The euro area isn’t workingSince the crisis started, unemployment has risen by 50% in the euro area as a whole, doubled in Italy, tripled in Greece and Spain, and quadrupled in Portugal. As of May 2013, unemployment rates were at record highs (generally since the mid-1980s) for the euro area (12.2%) and the European Union (11.0%), as well as in Slovenia (10.2%), Italy (12.2%), Cyprus (16.3%), Portugal (17.6%), Greece (26.8%) and Spain (26.9%). By comparison, unemployment in the non-EU OECD stood at 5.7%, having risen by less than 1bp since end-2007. Long-term unemployment and youth unemployment — probably the most economically and socially harmful forms of unemployment — are particularly high in many euro area countries. In 2012, around one-fifth of young persons in Italy, Greece, Spain and Ireland were ‘NEETs’ (not in employment, education or training) and the NEET ratio has risen in all EU countries since 2008.",481
146,"In addition to the general rise in joblessness, its divergence across euro area countries has been stark. In January 2008, the highest unemployment rate in the euro area (Spain at 9.0%) was less than three times the lowest (Netherlands at 3.2%). In May 2013, unemployment rates ranged from 4.7% in Austria to 26.9% in Spain. Labour reform has worked in the past, but conditions are not as benign todayPrecedents for successful labor market reforms in Europe in recent decades include Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK in the 1980s, Denmark in the 1990s and Germany in the 2000s. These reforms were all implemented from a position of relative weakness of economic performance. All of them involved a moderation in labor costs, achieved by a varying mix of negotiated wage moderation (through collective bargaining), less generous employment benefits, a lower “tax wedge” (the sum of labor income tax and employer and employee social security contributions), and reductions in union power. Virtually all also included an increased emphasis on active labor market policies (ALMPs), and most a reduction in public payroll. Compared with previous reforms, euro area periphery countries today suffer from a lack of social capital, lower skill levels in the workforce and less fiscal flexibility. In addition, all except Ireland are relatively closed economies and the external environment is more challenging. Meaningful reform efforts in labor markets, benefit systems and pensions have taken place in recent years in the euro area, in particular in the periphery and often mandated by the troika programs for Greece, Ireland and Portugal since 2010 and 2011. Virtually all euro area countries have put in place some ALMPs to support job creation, particularly for the young and low-skilled, and most euro area countries have reviewed their education systems with a view to producing more employable school and university graduates and boosting graduation rates. Finally, all have reformed their pension systems to some extent, generally based on fiscal considerations, but usefully also boosting the prospects of higher labor force participation in the face of adverse demographics. Labor reform will be tough…We are cautiously optimistic about the prospect for further labor market reform, even in the absence of troika pressure or financial market pressures, as high unemployment itself will put pressure on governments to act. Even though progress has been achieved in deregulating euro area labor markets, plenty of work remains.",496
147,"Labor cost competitiveness has still only moderately improved (and non-wage labor costs remain very high), and employment protection remains extensive (particularly in terms of the burden of regulation, including legal reviews and challenges leading to costly delays, rather than levels of severance pay and notice periods, per se). Minimum wages are also quite high, and labor market duality remains a major problem. One of the major problems in many economically weak euro area countries is that the mismatch between the skills available in the labor force and those appropriate to profitable employment is quite wide, and that the average skill level in the labor force is too low. Low employability of parts of the workforce, particularly in euro area periphery countries, and little hope of raising skill levels quickly probably mean that labor costs for these low-skilled workers have to fall substantially if they are to find sustainable employment in the private sector. A low-wage sector and probably extensive and long-lasting ALMPs may be necessary to get low-skilled workers back into jobs, but fiscally weak euro area countries would struggle to pay for these ALMPs. Even in the countries that have legislated quite substantial reforms to date, much remains to be done. In those countries, implementation of already-decided reforms remains a big concern, as is the involvement (and slow operation) of the courts in many aspects of the labor market. But a number of other euro area countries are at best just beginning to reform, including Belgium, France and the Netherlands. It is in these countries that labor market rigidities are probably highest in the euro area today. Labor market rigidities also remain substantial in the three countries with the lowest unemployment rates (Austria, Germany and Luxembourg). …but alone won’t restore growthLabor market reforms will help — or in the medium term even be necessary for — the euro area to recover. But in the near term they won’t be sufficient to create growth and jobs. For growth, a pickup in (effective) demand is needed. To the extent that reforms can boost private demand, say by awakening entrepreneurial, corporate and household animal spirits, product market reforms may well offer more promise than labor market reforms. Such reforms include opening closed professions, making it easier to open or operate businesses, improving the ability to collateralize land, property and other private possessions, and completing the single market for services in the European Union.",475
148,"Product market reforms are also being pursued in many euro area countries, but progress lags that made on the labor market side. Structural reforms also take time to show up in output and employment. In fact, labor market reforms often raise unemployment in the short term. In the reform examples noted above employment growth in some cases took years to gain sustainable momentum. In our view, an excess of debt (public and private), a weak banking sector, continued fiscal austerity and substantial policy uncertainty (domestic and at the euro area level) are larger impediments to growth currently than structural rigidities, particularly in the relatively closed euro area economies. Consequently, debt reduction (public and private), a decisive restructuring of the banking sector and a reduction in policy uncertainty would likely boost demand much more in the euro area in the near term than structural reform could. Without debt reduction, a fiscal and/or monetary boost to aggregate demand and a reduction in policy uncertainty, the risk rises that structural reforms in fact make things worse in the near term. Structural reforms often ‘work’ in the near term by being deflationary or at least disinflationary, which would make it harder to repay outstanding debt. In principle, this could be compensated by action from the central bank to counteract the disinflationary effect of the reforms, but there is a risk that the European Central Bank will act too timidly. In addition, reforms often increase uncertainty in the minds of households and enterprises, and raise precautionary saving and/or reduce investment as a result. A cautious outlook: High unemployment to persist and several risks to riseHistory provides little reason to be optimistic about the prospects for euro area unemployment. For instance, in all recessions in Italy, Portugal and Spain since the 1970s, the earliest unemployment peaked was 5 quarters after real GDP growth turned positive and much later in some cases. We believe unemployment in the euro area will peak in 2014 versus estimates by the European Commission expecting the peak to probably come at some time this year. But the point is not so much whether unemployment will peak this year, next year or in 2015. Rather, the issue is that unemployment will likely stay high for a long time. Some simple calculations are instructive (and sobering). The evolution of unemployment can be derived from the change in the ‘output gap’ (i.e. the difference between output growth and potential output) and the effect of falling output gaps on (un)employment.",495
149,"The latter is usually referred to as ‘Okun’s law’. Estimates exist for both. The European Central Bank (ECB) estimates the Okun’s law coefficient for the euro area to be 0.3, meaning that a 1 percentage point reduction in the output gap would lower the unemployment rate by 0.3 percentage points. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also produces forecasts for the output gap which imply that the euro area output gap would fall by roughly 0.5 percentage points each year in 2015-18. If we put the two together, the implication is that unemployment in the euro area would only fall by less than 1 percentage point until the end of the decade. There is some reason to believe that this is probably a little too pessimistic and that employment may react more strongly to output than historically — this is where the labor market reforms and more flexibility would presumably make a difference — and emigration could also help. In fact, the IMF’s actual forecasts imply that unemployment would be three times as responsive to changes in the output gap. Although that implies that unemployment should fall faster if and when (above-potential) output growth resumes (the IMF thinks in 2014, we think it might be a year later), it still expects unemployment to be above 10% in the euro area even in 2018. The risks with continued unemployment are highOne risk is that reform efforts will run out of steam before euro area economies have become competitive, so that even these forecasts prove optimistic. An even more worrying risk is that continued high unemployment will raise the prospects of widespread social unrest. Even if the more extreme reflections of public dissatisfaction are avoided, these factors will likely have a significant impact on political decisions and outcomes, and on growth prospects. ‘Austerity fatigue’ is often closely related to ‘unemployment fatigue’ and before long could become ‘debt service fatigue’. These considerations all play a major role in our assessment that sovereign debt restructuring will be a material risk for a number of euro area economies with high public debt.

However, interest in the virtual world spiked at the end of 2021 following a rise in sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as well as announcements from Big Tech players indicating their interest and investment in the space.Today, the most popular way to experience the Metaverse is via a video game played on a virtual reality (VR) headset. But in the report that follows, we discuss the possibility that the Metaverse is moving towards becoming the next iteration of the internet, or Web3. This “Open Metaverse” would be community-owned, community-governed, and a freely interoperable version that ensures privacy by design.Users should increasingly be able to access a host of use cases, including commerce, art, media, advertising, healthcare, and social collaboration. A device-agnostic Metaverse would be accessible via personal computers, game consoles, and smartphones, resulting in a large ecosystem. Using this broad definition, the total addressable market for the Metaverse could be between $8 trillion and $13 trillion by 2030, with total Metaverse users numbering around five billion.But getting to that market level is going to require infrastructure investment. The content streaming environment of the Metaverse will likely require a computational efficiency improvement of over 1,000x today’s levels. Investment will be needed in areas such as compute, storage, network infrastructure, consumer hardware, and game development platforms.The definition of what counts as money in the Open Metaverse is also likely to be very different from what counts as money in the real world today. Interoperability and seamless exchange between underlying blockchain technology are critical to ensure a frictionless user experience. Different forms of cryptocurrency are expected to dominate, but given the multi-chain trend in the crypto ecosystem, cryptocurrency will likely coexist with fiat currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and stablecoins.Finally, if the Metaverse is indeed the new iteration of the internet, it will mostly likely attract greater scrutiny from global regulators, policymakers, and governments.",499

Migration and the Economy- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle06 Sep 2018Migration and the EconomyEconomic Realities, Social Impacts & Political ChoicesCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadFormer UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon defined migration as “an expression of the human aspiration for dignity, safety and a better future. It is part of the social fabric, part of our very make-up as a human family”. In recent years, however, and especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, immigration has become a toxic issue in election campaigns and the political debate in many advanced economies, with politicians and other interested parties trading insults and soundbites but leaving a proper evaluation of the real impacts of migration on the economy and society often absent from the noise.In this report, we have sought to take a detailed and balanced perspective on the impact of immigration on advanced economies, and particularly on those in Europe and North America where the popular concerns regarding migration appear to be especially acute. This report forms part of a wider series of work in our Citi GPS series where we have looked at complex societal issues that have a profound impact on global growth and the performance of the wider economy. The originality of this report is both in providing fresh evidence of the implications for growth and the dynamism of economies and also in our consideration of the fiscal costs and benefits of migration in terms of taxes and expenditures. In addition, we have attempted to understand, explain and analyze the political debate around migration through reviewing much of the available literature and opinion polls to assess where and how the fault lines have occurred in the public discourse on migration.This report is focused on economic migrants who have not been compelled to migrate either as refugees or through force. Although economic migrants may come from extreme poverty, by and large they migrate as a matter of choice. Their destination countries also have a choice whether to accept them or not.",406
153,"In this report we use the term migrants and immigrants, or migration and immigration, interchangeably to refer to the movement of people across national borders.To produce this report, Citi Research has partnered with Professor Ian Goldin who not only has worked with us for over five years through our research partnership with The Oxford Martin School but who is also a specialist on migration and who is an author of the highly acclaimed 2011 book Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped our World and Will define Our Future. Professor Goldin is currently the Oxford University Professor of Globalisation and Development. His full biography can be found in the author block of this report.In the preparation of this report, we have conducted a very extensive literature review of the research written on migration, updated the data sets from Professor Goldin’s 2011 work, and undertaken a number of new data modelling exercises. While some very clear conclusions emerge as we outline below in this introductory summary, we have also sought to highlight areas of acknowledged academic or public dispute in the narrative on migration. We have also tried to balance economic analysis with social impacts and an understanding of the drivers of the political debate.Part of the objective of this report is to provide a more granular approach to throw light on the growing disconnect between public perceptions regarding migration and the actual trends. This disconnect is illustrated, for example, in the change in negative perceptions regarding immigration in different European countries, which suggests that there is almost no direct correlation between the number of migrants (and refugees) that a country accepts and the attitudes to migration.We recognize, of course, that the implications for many other global regions, and not least developing countries as both the source and destination of migration, are also very significant, not least in terms of the implications of the so called ‘brain drain’ which suggests that the benefits migrants bring to the advanced economies may be at the cost of undermining development in their countries of origin. This need not be the case as migrants typically contribute materially to their destination country, while at the same time contributing to their dependents and countries of origin and advancing their own lives.",419

Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) - CitiGPSOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle25 Apr 2019Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)Citi GPS InsightsCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsContributor(s):  Willem BuiterCatherine L MannShareDownloadWhat’s right is not new, what’s new is not right, and what’s left is too simplistic  A quick synopsis of MMT: A sovereign nation with its own fiat currency, its public debt denominated in its own currency and a floating exchange rate cannot go broke. The only limit on public spending is inflation, and this is not a binding constraint for the U.S. In some versions of the MMT, the price level is set by the government.   What’s right is not new: (1) To consolidate the finances of the central government and the central bank for the assessment of overall sovereign indebtedness. (2) To acknowledge that the State has a monopoly on money issuance. (3) To analyze this monopoly in the context of profitable seigniorage, which can loosen the budget constraint. Already incorporated into consolidated budget math is seignior age worth at least 0.3 % of real GDP, or around $64 billon, and possibly twice that.   What’s new is not right: (1) Government deficits are logically prior to surpluses because tax payers have to pay their taxes in government money. This ignores the fact that the State can lend to the private sector. (2) The public debt is not a burden on the future. This assumes that any previous public debt issuance was sufficiently catalytic on the private sector to generate the where-with-all to repay the borrowing, with interest. MMTers and supply-siders are odd bed-fellows here. (3) The government need only set one nominal price and then let market forces determine relative prices while printing money at will creates an inconsistency with monetary equilibrium. Experience with the gold standard is relevant in this regard.   What’s left is too simplistic: (1) The proposition that the State will not default ignores the case where the inflationary consequences of monetary finance (hyperinflation, say) dominates. (2) The proposition that the U.S. State always has the ‘exorbitant privilege” skips over evidence from both currency and U.S. Treasury markets that this privilege is not immutable.",501

When we hear the story of how the invention of the automobile hastened the demise of buggy whip companies, we often question why the disruptive potential of gas-powered cars wasn’t noticed. In the modern era, most people buying digital cameras in the 1990s would have scoffed at the idea that in a few years’ time, we would all be carrying around cameras in our mobile phones. The potential for tokenization via blockchain has been talked about as being transformative for the past few years but we are not quite at the point of mass adoption. Unlike automobiles or more recent innovations like ChatGPT or the Metaverse, blockchain is a back-end infrastructure technology without a prominent consumer interface, making it harder to visibly see how it could be innovative. But we believe we are approaching an inflection point, where the promised potential of blockchain will be realized and be measured in billions of users and trillions of dollars in value. Successful adoption will be when blockchain has a billion-plus users who do not even realize they are using the technology. This is likely to be driven by the adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) by large central banks as well as tokenized assets in gaming and blockchain-based payments on social media. By 2030, up to $5 trillion of CBDCs could be circulating in major economies in the world, half or which could be linked to distributed ledger technology. Tokenization of financial and real-work assets could be the killer use case driving blockchain breakthrough with tokenization expected to grow by a factor of 80x in private markets and reach up to almost $4 trillion in value by 2030. We first wrote about tokenization in the 2021 Citi GPS report Future of Money: CBDCs, Crypto, and 21st Century Cash. At the time, China was starting to pilot test its (CBDC) and other central banks were warming up to the idea of their own digital currencies.",474
156,"In recent months, central banks in multiple large countries have announced plans for CBDCs this decade, giving almost 2 billion people the opportunity to experiment with digital currency. To be successfully adopted into the mainstream, blockchain needs the help of technology enablers, including (1) decentralized digital identities, (2) zero-knowledge proofs, (3) Oracles, and (4) secure bridges. The legal plumbing also needs to be altered to enable smart legal contracts that will provide a whole new set of rails for global commerce and finance to run on. Regulatory considerations are also necessary to allow adoption and scalability without the hindering innovation. Although we think mass adoption could still be six to eight years away, momentum on adoption has positively shifted as governments, large institutions, and corporations have moved from investigating the benefits of tokenization to trials and proofs of concept.Billions of UsersBlockchain user numbers will be boosted by daily activity. The success of blockchain adoption will be measured by when it is being used by a billion plus end users who do not even realize they are using the technology. Blockchain-based products can make a significant impact in terms of wide consumer adoption in digital currency, especially central bank digital currency (CBDCs), gaming, and social.  Trillions in ValueAlmost anything of value can be tokenized and tokenization of financial and real-world assets could be the “killer use-case” blockchain needs to drive a breakthrough. We forecast $4 trillion to $5 trillion of tokenized digital securities and $1 trillion of distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based trade finance volumes by 2030.Technology EnablersBlockchain promises something that is in parts a replacement of a current functioning system and in parts new capabilities and operating models. From a technology specification perspective, blockchain needs to have transaction scale and throughput, strong guarantees of security, on-chain identity, privacy, Oracles, bridges, and good user experience.Legal EnablersContract creation and execution can be a painful process, making it ripe for disruption.

157,"global insights citigps music industry. Putting The band Back Together- Citi Global Perspectives and SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle06 Aug 2018Putting the Band Back TogetherRemastering the World of MusicCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadThe music industry is in the midst of two profound changes. First, consumers are increasingly opting to rent — rather than buy — music. Second, the demise of physical music has prompted artists to tour more often, driving significant growth in concerts and festivals.In the U.S., the music industry generated $43 billion in revenue, matching the prior peak in 2006. While business-to-business (B2B) revenues (Music Publishing and Licensing) and music ads (AM/FM, YouTube) are flattish, consumer outlays (Concerts, Subscriptions) are at all-time highs.While consumer spending habits are undergoing profound changes, the current industry structure has remained relatively static. That is, record labels are still record labels. Music distributors — Apple, Pandora, Sirius, and Spotify — are just music distributors. And, concert promoters — like Live Nation and AEG — are still concert promoters.Artists’ share of music revenues is small. In 2017, artists captured just 12% of music revenue with most of the value leakage driven by the costs of running a myriad of distribution platforms — AM/FM radio, satellite radio, Internet distributors — augmented by the costs (and profits) of the record labels.The proportion captured by artists is, however, on the rise (it was just 7% of industry revenues in 2000). The bulk of the improvement is not driven by the growth in music subscription services. Rather, it’s driven by the strength in the concert business. Music labels act as intermediaries for subscription services (Apple, Spotify) but are largely excluded from the economics of the concert business. As such, growth in concert revenue is particularly helpful to artists.With this backdrop, we think there are three ways the industry’s structure could evolve. First, we could see vertical integration. For example, concert promoters could merge with an existing distribution platform. Second, we could see horizontal integration. For example, existing distribution firms could consolidate. Third, we could see organic forms of vertical integration. That is, existing web-based distribution firms could organically morph into music labels (by targeting younger, less established artists).",492

Public Wealth of Cities - Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountVideo19 Mar 2018The Public Wealth of CitiesHow to Turn Around Cities Fortunes by Unlocking Public AssetsCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadIf you either live or work in New York City you get used to things being crowded — sidewalks, shops, streets, buses, trains, buses — pretty much everywhere you go there are people with you. Presumably it is the same in most other large metropolitan areas as cities are increasingly becoming places where people want to live. Although overall city population growth averages less than 1% in the U.S., what has been different recently is that the infrastructure in the city itself has aged, leading to an increased perception that the city is more crowded – subways feel more crowded as old signal equipment failures lead to train delays, overdue maintenance on roads and bridges leads to road congestion and increased traffic jams and commuter trains are running ‘standing room only’ into urban train stations that are at capacity.    In our 2016 Citi GPS report Infrastructure for Growth, we found the total global need for infrastructure spending was $58.6 trillion over the next 15 years. At the same time that report noted the world had an enormous infrastructure investment deficit with infrastructure spend as a percentage of GDP falling to around 3.3% - below what we viewed as a necessary level of 4.1% of GDP by 2020.Dag Detter and Stefan Fölster had previously argued in a Citi GPS report The Public Wealth of Nations that one of the ways nations could find money for infrastructure projects is by putting their public assets to work by managing them better and accounting for them on their national balance sheets. In their new book The Public Wealth of Cities, they update their argument to focus on cities, noting that most cities in the U.S. are facing an impending investment disaster, with a crisis in physical investment as well as a lack of funds to invest in the development of social and human assets.But there are standout cities that are doing much better than others and in fact can pull their countries along towards better growth and social development. These “turbo cities” have made canny investments that make their daily operation cheaper, more effective, and sometimes even yields a direct return. This gives economic muscle for further investments.",492
159,"The secret to turbo cities is that they make the value of their long-term investments more transparent and visible and make evidence-based decisions at arms’ length from day-to-day politics.Detter and Fölster advocate three steps for cities to move towards turbo cities: know your assets, allow more professional management of city assets, and shift expenditures from consumption to investment.",71

The Public Wealth Of Nations - Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle11 Jun 2015The Public Wealth of NationsUnlocking the value of global public assetsCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadIn his foreword to the book The Public Wealth of Nations, Adrian Wooldridge, Management Editor of The Economist, suggests that Dag Detter and Stefan Fölster have proposed a new idea in the public policy arena which not only identifies a problem that few people had realized existed, but suggests a relatively pain-free way to tackle it while at the same time boosting the size of the global economy.The idea rests on the observation that governments around the world have an estimated $75 trillion of dollars of public assets, ranging from corporations to forests, which are often badly managed and frequently not even accounted for on their balance sheets. Over recent decades, policy makers have focused almost solely on managing debt while largely ignoring the question of public wealth. Given that in most countries public wealth is larger than public debt, just managing it better could help to solve the debt problem while also providing the material for future economic growth. A higher return of just 1% on global public assets would add some $750 billion to public revenues. Poor management not only throws money down the drain, but also forecloses opportunities. As an example, the fracking revolution, which is making the U.S. self-sufficient in oil, has taken place almost entirely on private land.In this Citi GPS report and as a preview to their upcoming book, Dag Detter and Stefan Fölster present their thesis that the governance of public wealth is one of the crucial institutional building blocks that divides well-run countries from failed states. They argue that the polarized debate between privatizers and nationalizers has missed the point — what really matters is the quality of asset management, and the focus when it comes to public wealth should be on yield rather than ownership. They calculate that improvements in public wealth management could yield returns greater than the world’s combined investment in infrastructure such as transport, power, water and communications. They also note that improvements in public wealth management could help to win the war against corruption as assets are moved at an arm’s length from politicians.",466
161,"global insights citigps purposeful innovation finance. Purposeful Innovation in Finance- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle15 Jan 2019Purposeful Innovation in FinanceCiti GPS Opinion ArticleCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsContributor(s):  Jason Channell(Global Head of Sustainable Finance Citi Global Insights, Citi Research)ShareDownloadFor many, a real perception exists that leaders, politicians, policymakers and those characterized as the 'elite' are not listening to the broader population, which increases the sense of frustrated marginalization. The trait of 'I know better' is not limited to the elite but manifests itself across many areas of society — such as the controversial policy of 'no platforming' being witnessed at some universities in the U.K. This provides an example of a perhaps increasingly intolerant and selfish society — which highlights the importance of values in society and the importance of the dignity of, and respect afforded to, the individual.Inequality is a hugely important topic and one that we examined in great detail in our recent report written in conjunction with the Oxford Martin School: Citi GPS - Inequality and Prosperity in the Industrialized World. Inequality within countries has indeed risen markedly in recent years, as has inequality between generations, regions, and even companies. As we observed in the report, inequality matters economically because countries with greater levels of inequality often grow less fast than more equal countries, and there is reason to believe that growth is also more fragile. Inequality leads to declining social trust, the erosion of social cohesion and degradation of the political processes via lower electoral engagement, and it has even been linked to poorer health. Inequality also appears to be self-perpetuating, with the significant correlation between intergenerational mobility and the GINI coefficient implying a lower level of social mobility in less equal societies, again a key factor in the perception of equality and opportunity, which can be so important to an individual’s sense of self-esteem.As always, however, beneath the headlines, the detail can sometimes paint a different (though less attention-grabbing) picture. It is important to draw distinctions between income inequality and wealth inequality (typically defined as the share of aggregate wealth owned by the top 1%), as the latter is typically more unequally distributed. The U.K.",474
162,"actually has, in a relative sense, an intermediate level of wealth inequality, despite having relatively high income inequality, while the reverse is true for Germany and the Netherlands. It is also worth noting that wealth inequality was substantially higher in the early 20th century in many economies than it is today. Alvaredo et. al.  estimated that the share of the top 1% in the U.K. may have been as high as 70% in the early years of the 20th century and was still about 45% mid-century compared to around 20% currently. Moreover, in contrast to most developed countries, U.K. income inequality as defined by the Gini coefficient has actually declined since 2008, which flies in the face of the popular perception. However, regional and intergenerational inequality has risen, and it is this (along with other factors, such as wage growth) that is potentially more likely to be what is being 'felt'. Whatever one’s view of this complex subject — facts or semantics — the key point is that the belief of inequality is there and forms a key element of the sense of not being listened to and of frustrated marginalization. It is also worth considering the extent to which our ever-more connected world is a factor in the cementing of concepts into perceived wisdom and ultimately accepted realities. We do not intend to reproduce the wealth of detail contained in our Citi GPS inequality report in full in this limited response but highlight it as a source for further reading.It is all too easy to lay the blame for the increase in inequality at the foot of globalization. However, as the Centesimus Annus Encyclical of 1991 effectively points out, globalization, if monitored, can be an enormous source for good. Indeed, while inequality within countries has generally increased, global inequality (and inequality between countries) has declined since the late 1980s and particularly rapidly from 2008 as developing countries have closed the gap with developed countries. This is a direct reversal of the trend from the early 19th century to the late 1980s, when global inequality consistently increased. It is impossible to delink these more recent normalizations from the effects of globalization, which has, in hand with technology, arguably driven the most accelerated period of collective 'progress' in history.",469
163,"Since 1990, the number of people living in extreme poverty, on less than $1.90 per day, fell from 1.9 billion (35% of the population) to 836 million (11%) by 2015, despite the global population rising by 39%, from 5.3 billion people to 7.4 billion, over the same period.But enormous challenges remain. More than a quarter of the world still lacks access to clean water, while a third of us — some 2.4 billion people — lack access to basic sanitation, and a billion people lack access to electricity. Undernourishment affects 815 million people — more than one in ten of us go to bed hungry each night, while one-third of all food produced is wasted. Forty percent of children under the age of 14 (770 million) still lack access to a full education; aside from the obvious impact that a full education might have on their own lives, what impact might almost another 1 billion well-educated people have on the global economy, on the eradication of poverty, and on all the associated implications for conflict around the world?With that backdrop, we bring this paper around to two of the key issues — finance and technology — to be discussed as part of the Dublin Process convened by Centesimus Annus Pro Pontifice in January 2019 and to which this paper forms a submission.Technology can be an enormous force for positive progress, greater inclusivity and reduced inequality in the world. Mobile banking and financial technology (fintech) have the potential to lift millions out of poverty, for example by including the 2 billion people around the world who remain 'unbanked', which can easily lead to their exploitation at the end of long global supply chains. New on-line educational models have the potential not just to address some of the issues raised above but also opportunities for adult learning around the world and for re-training/re-skilling, which is likely to be a necessity resulting from the longer-term impacts of greater adoption of automation and AI on employment models, as we examined in our Technology at Work Citi GPS series. Alternative energy brings enormous potential for distributed generation and social and economic advancement. But none of this progress can be achieved at any scale without the finance to facilitate it.If globalization has been a key player in that enormous progress achieved since 1990, then finance has played a critical role in facilitating globalization.",493
164,"If applied correctly, with the correct moral compass, finance can be an enormous force for good. This brings us back to the key concepts of the original Rerum Novarum Encyclical of 1891 — that profit in itself is not a bad thing, whereas deliberate, exploitative profit at the expense of someone else may be morally unacceptable.Finance can play an important role in social development, and recent developments in the finance industry provide enormous cause for optimism. Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) originally grew out of faith-based investor groups that were unwilling to invest in industries such as alcohol, tobacco and armaments. While initially a very small part of the investment world, 2018 was the year that saw the broader concept of Sustainable Investing move very much into the mainstream. The signatories to the UN-backed Principles of Responsible Investment (the PRI) — who have publicly committed to integrate ESG (environmental, social and governance) factors into their investment processes — now have combined assets under management (AUM) of some $83 trillion, a similar figure to one year's total global GDP. While not all of the AUM of those signatories will be ESG funds per se, the amounts that are now estimated to be directly ESG screened or managed are about $30 trillion in equities, with a similar figure in credit.This provides the perfect example for the Dublin Process discussions of how religious teaching, values and practice can lead by example and provide a moral compass that the world, in time, may come to adopt more widely.It is correct that some of these assets may be paying lip service, but our broad experience in speaking to investors around the globe suggests that these are in the minority. The root of this fundamental shift lies in the changing attitudes of the ultimate asset owners — and asset managers are simply moving to reflect this. This shift could best be described as an increasing focus not just on the quantum of financial returns but on how those returns are made.Whilst in the past it might have been possible (albeit not ethically or morally responsible) to exploit either the physical or human resources in a supply chain based in some faraway corner of the world, our technologically and social media-connected world now makes it much harder for corporations to hide the skeletons in the closet. More fundamentally, consumers care about how their food is reared, grown or caught, and they are willing to pay premiums for healthy alternatives or for products that are sustainably sourced.",497
165,"Supply chains are paramount to brand perception, to pricing points and to consumer propensity to buy. Utilities are moving away from carbon-intensive generation, not least because of an inability to finance carbon-intensive fuels, while the transportation industry is undergoing its own evolution. The packaging and plastics industries are facing what could genuinely be couched as existential questions. In addition to increased environmental and social focus, all around the world, from Europe, to South Korea to Japan, we are seeing an equally dramatically increased focus on corporate governance, on stewardship codes, on diversity and on inclusion. The finance industry is facilitating these trends by developing new products, such as green bonds and social bonds, whereby the payment or quantum of a coupon can depend on the achievement of certain socially oriented goals. In Australia, the concept of universal ownership has taken root, in recognition that some of the Australian Superannuation Funds are such broad owners of assets that they are a systemic player and have not just a vested interest but also a responsibility to help to guide the overall economy in societally optimal directions, towards a sustainable future.This last point is perhaps the most critical of this response. Large parts of the financial world have now woken up to the fact that whilst a short-term profit may have attractions, a model predicated on a resource running out — or at worst on an exploitative approach or where returns are unsustainably high — is highly likely to go out of business or ultimately be regulated out of existence. The recognition that a more sustainable business model that is fit for the longer term may be significantly more valuable surely must be viewed as a purposeful, positive innovation in finance. Moreover, the increasing awareness of the 'social license to operate' amongst corporates could be argued to reflect a much greater focus on moral values and ethics in business and finance, very much in line with the broader concepts discussed in the original 'Rerum Novarum' of 1891.Moreover, there is a growing understanding that ESG factors are financial factors and that all of these issues — from selling prices to volumes, operating costs, financing costs, tax rates and funding sources — are inextricably linked with ESG, reflecting an encouraging symbiosis between financial and societal returns.But it is more than just not wanting to be associated with 'bad' things.",464
166,"An even greater cause for optimism comes from the rise in impact investing and the important concept of 'additionality' — i.e., the additional positive impact that a particular investment has made on achieving an improvement in a sustainability-related metric, as opposed to being merely aligned with it. Investors increasingly want to demonstrate a positive impact from their investment and are encouraging companies to report on the impacts of their own operations, both positive and negative. It is typically hard for investors to demonstrate additionality purely by buying a listed equity from someone who has sold it. However, additionality can be demonstrated via engagement, which brings us back to a more basic question of ""what is investment?""Is it simply trying to be slightly smarter than the next investor to gain a return, or is it trying to invest in a business and helping that business to grow and outperform? (This chimes well with one of the key points from the Centesimus Annus Encyclical of 1991 regarding whether a particular type of work actually adds value to the system.) Again, a greater level of active engagement with business managements to achieve more positive societal outcomes and more sustainable business models (and yes, ultimately higher financial returns) is surely a good thing, which flies in the face of our fears of an increasingly disengaged, selfish and intolerant world. Conclusions So in a society where values and ethics may appear to be overshadowed by the clouds of selfishness and intolerance, we believe that significant sources of optimism can be found in recent innovations in finance, suggesting an increasing recognition of the need for a balance between financial and societal returns.The benefits of globalization are clear, but we need a balance of globalization and localization. We should try to eschew the short-term win, embracing instead the longer-term, more sustainable and ultimately more valuable option. Success and better communication of longer-term goals and plans have an important role to play. Regulation also clearly has an important role to play, but we must be careful not to over-regulate and stifle innovation. Personal responsibility and a focus on ethics and moral compass must also play an important part, as highlighted by other papers written for the Dublin Process.We should consider our investments in a broader context, recognizing their impacts, both positive and negative, and being mindful of feedback loops.",462
167,"We can adopt frameworks to align our investments with societal goals, as an increasing number of investors are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, an issue examined at length in our report Citi GPS - UN SDGs: Pathways to Success - A Systematic Framework for Aligning Investments. The increasing levels of disclosure provided by Corporate Sustainability Reports, and efforts such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), play an important role, as do initiatives to standardize sustainability reporting, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and those by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Organizations such as the PRI can also play a critical role in purposeful financial innovation as well as drive systemic change. Investors should continue to increase their levels of engagement on the topics raised (and importantly not raised) in these reports and should demand greater levels of transparency, so that they are truly aware of what they are investing in and the implications of that investment, especially if they wish to claim additionality. Other measures could also help to reduce short termism – such as the view held by many that quarterly reporting adds little and can indeed take a company's attention away from longer-term goals to focus on maximizing shorter-term results.Finance can — if done in a longer-term, responsible, ethical and moral manner — facilitate so much positive progress globally, and financial markets and financial innovation have the potential to align the trillions of dollars that investors want to invest sustainably with the vast need for investment around the world. We have an individual and a collective responsibility to address the myriad of sustainability and ethical-related challenges in the world today, and if we do so successfully, the rewards, both societally and financially, are inestimable.Authors: Jason Channell,Authors: Jason Channell,Authors: Authors: Jason Channell,Authors: Jason Channell,Click here to view the report in full.GPS OpinionInclusive SeriesUP NEXTArticleUnited Nations Sustainable Development GoalsCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleRethinking Single-Use PlasticsCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoEnergy Darwinism IICiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",490

Re-Birth of the Telecom Monopoly- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle25 Nov 2014Re-Birth of the Telecom MonopolyIs the industry broken and heading back to its monopolistic roots?Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadRemember when speed dialing on your phone was only possible because you switched from a rotary dial phone to a push-button touch-tone phone? It was sometime in the late 1970s/early 1980s when a majority of customers in the U.S. converted to push-button telephones and at just about the same time the first commercial cellular networks were launched in Japan and northern Europe and cable television moved from something only offered in remote communities to improve broadcast reception to PayTV services. It was also that start of the biggest change in the telecom industry model in at least 100 years.In 1982, regulators in the U.S. made a crucial decision to liberalize the telecom market and break up telecom monopoly AT&T based partly on new technologies with significant mass-market disruptive power (such as cable TV and wireless) but also on an awareness that the Internet was going to be the next big phenomenon which required the deployment of new communications technologies. This kicked off a global move toward telecom liberalization which fueled the TMT revolution.Thirty-two years later, the global telecom industry looks shockingly different. Mobile phone penetration is approaching 100% globally and the Internet has become the backbone of the global economy, but the telecom industry looks to be broken. It is close to ex-growth; the pressure to invest into the next ‘big thing’ is growing while the likes of Skype and WhatsApp are eroding its entry barriers and pressing down its returns; and its current business model raises more questions than answers.What happened? This report argues that liberalization, infrastructure competition and unrestricted equal access to any on-line information (net neutrality) have helped to connect the world incredibly fast.",414
169,"However, this policy combination has failed to produce a stable telecom business model suited for the future world, where all humans will be connected and many will rely on smart machines, robots or complex global systems not only for their work, pleasure and convenience, but also security, finances, health or even life.Hesitation of most policymakers to acknowledge the need for fundamental overhaul of telecom policies and to outline the direction of upcoming changes has led to weak and excessively short-term focused telecom strategies, unstable business models, preservation of inefficiencies as well as a culture that is unsupportive of innovation at local level.This report suggests the case for reviewing of the key policies on telecom competition and net neutrality is now stronger than ever. It proposes an alternative model based on pragmatic, reality-driven compromises and industry-vision. It advocates: 1) retaining infrastructure competition in areas where it is economically beneficial; 2) creation of structurally separated natural monopolies elsewhere; 3) creation of a viable wholesale market; and 4) conceptually non-neutral networks with regulation assuring basic services and avoiding potential abuse.This new model would produce a range of TMT and diversified service companies with varied backgrounds, product offerings and geographical reach, competing with each other on a basis of innovation and differentiation.",253

Re-birth of The Telecoms- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountVideo04 Oct 2016Re-Birth of Telecoms into a New Digital IndustryTime to Dump the Dumb PipeCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadTime to Dump the Dumb Pipe   As a teenager I was fortunate enough to spend a few weeks in Ireland every summer with my grandmother. I promised to call when I got to the village, which meant going to the phone box outside the Post Office armed with a pocketful of coins, picking up the receiver and asking Alice (who worked in the Post Office) to connect me with an overseas operator who would finally put my through to my parents in New York. Over the years, the routine of “calling when I got there” stayed the same but how I made the call changed dramatically. As technology advanced and new infrastructure was built, the manual operator-to-operator connection was upgraded, and my calls moved to a fixed-line phone in the house and, eventually, to a mobile phone. Although the equipment was different, there was always a hefty charge that went to the telecom operator — Telecom Éireann, AT&T or Verizon. Today when I get to the village, I still “call home” but it’s usually by logging into the WiFi in the local pub and having a quick FaceTime chat. The biggest difference is that my calls are now essentially free.Over the past two decades, telecom companies have been busy building infrastructure that is critical to the communications sector — copper, cellular/mobile, cable, and fiber networks— and these networks are now the backbone of our increasingly digital economy. This connectivity-driven revolution has created some of the world’s largest companies who generate their profits by using the infrastructure that the telecom sector has built.",383
171,"While telecom operators have seen minimal industry growth of just 0%–3% in the past few years, sectors that use their networks such as Internet Services are seeing growth at rates at least six times higher.So what’s a telecom operator to do? We believe they have two choices: (1) they can streamline their business and continue providing the ‘dumb pipe’ to the digital ecosystem, or (2) they can embark on a digital transformation.In the report that follows, we investigate what a digital transformation would entail, how the future post-telecom era digital connectivity industry may shape up, and what it may mean for telecom investors. We see the aim of the transformation as building new competitive advantages in digital areas that are less prone to regulation than basic infrastructure. This entails a mindset change by telecom operators away from selling digital connectivity and towards selling service-enabling digital platforms, both to consumers as well as business-to-business customers.Investors may not yet be ready to assign much value to telecom companies for this transformation but we believe this could form the basis of a new and more sustainable long-term value creation story, at least for some telecoms. Operators’ ability to benefit from the digital transformation may vary substantially, but those in countries with less developed service industries — which have the skill to deliver and sell new services, the scale in their operations to make it profitable, and the right management style — will, in our view, likely succeed.",290

When we throw anything away it must go somewhere” — Annie Leonard, Executive Director of Greenpeace USARoughly half of global consumer packaging is made of plastic and over a third of resin that is produced by Chemical companies goes into packaging end markets. Plastics have become a staple of daily life in the modern world, steadily gaining share from other packaging materials over the last 50 years based on their low cost, durability, convenience, and malleability. However, environmental concerns around landfill contamination have grown steadily alongside increased plastics use, with a great deal of recent attention on ocean contamination and the growth of microplastics.While debates around the sustainability and recyclability of plastics have been long-running in Europe and the Americas, the Chinese government took a revolutionary approach earlier this year, deciding it would no longer import ~50% of the world’s scrap plastic and paper. As China has been the dominant importer of plastic scrap with an annual plastics consumption of 8 million tonnes, this has led to a collapse in the price of various recovered plastics materials, and a glut of oversupply piling up in Western ports.Echoing China’s actions, national and local governments have launched their own plastics bans. The U.K. has taken the lead position on preventing plastics waste with proposed bans on plastic cutlery, straws, and cotton buds/swabs. The EU has followed with their own ban, indicating once fully implemented in 2030 the changes could cost businesses over $3.5 billion per year. Some of the most aggressive bans have been in emerging market countries; given these countries’ per capita plastic use is very low, the bans have the potential to sharply impact future consumption growth of plastics.In response to increased environmental scrutiny, the plastics industry is not standing by idly. Chemical companies are adapting their portfolios and practices towards more environmentally-conscious strategies, focusing on light-weighing their products, investing in plastic recycling companies, improving recycling systems, and creating bio-based polymers.",480

We see a few potential ‘battleground’ packaging products, including soft drink bottles, coffee cups, protective packaging for e-Commerce, and retail bags.

Securing India's Growth- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountInclusive Economic Growth SeriesArticle20 Feb 2018Securing India's Growth Over the Next DecadeTwin Pillars of Investment & ProductivityCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadIn this report, we look specifically at India and what types of pillars can be identified to drive the country’s growth over the next decade. Although the past does not guarantee future results, we thought the best place to start the journey of how India can transform itself from an emerging economy into one that grows with a sustained GDP growth rate of 8%+, is to look at the lessons learned from countries which have already succeeded in transition. We found that growth in labor productivity of over 6%, growth in investment of over 10% and growth in the overall efficiency of production (the Total Factor Productivity) to 3% were the three primary drivers of GDP growth across our sample of countries. The final piece in the growth puzzle was that poorer economies grow faster in 60% of cases, those countries with 8%+ GDP growth had per capita income of less than $10,000.In order to achieve investment growth in the double digits and to create employment opportunities for its swelling labor force, India will need to industrialize further target manufacturing as a share of GDP to rise to 25% by 2025 from its current level of 18%. To do this, a new potential leading sector in manufacturing must be identified based on size, productivity, employability, and exportability. Our analysis identifies chemicals (including pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals) as a promising candidate to move up the value chain, as well as food processing and textiles & apparel.In a previous Citi GPS report Infrastructure for Growth, we estimated that on average, a 1% increase in infrastructure investment associated with a 1.2% increase in GDP growth.",411
175,"In the case of India, we estimate that total infrastructure spend could be around $3 trillion in the next 10 years bringing the infrastructure (power, ports, roads, rails, telecom), reforms in input markets (land and labor), focus on soft infrastructure (healthcare reforms, education) and the harnessing of resources (oil & gas, coal, cement, iron & steel) would all lead to higher productivity and growth rates.Finally, exports as a productivity driver and employment creator could play a significant role in total factor productivity growth. If India can increase its export-to-GDP ratio (including service exports) to at least 20% by 2021, India’s exports could reach ~700 Billion.The result of all this growth would be higher per capita income, increasing urbanization, and a shift in consumer patterns as India moves up the ladder form a low-growth to a high-growth economy.Authors: Samiran Chakraborty,Anurag Jha,Venkatesh Balasubramaniam,Raashi Chopra, CFA,Johanna Chua,Jamshed Dadabhoy,Ronit Ghose, CFA,Surendra Goyal, CFA,Saurabh Handa,Rishi V Iyer,Vijit Jain,Gaurav Malhotra, CFA,Aditya Mathur,Arvind Sharma,Atul Tiwari,Click here to view the report in full.Emerging MarketsGDPGrowthInclusive SeriesIndiaInfrastructureProductivityUP NEXTArticleChina’s Belt & Road at FiveCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleInequality and Prosperity in the Industrialized WorldCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoInfrastructure for GrowthCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",407

Solutions for a Global Water Crisis- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesArticle27 Apr 2017Solutions for A Global Water CrisisThe End of ‘Free and Cheap’ WaterCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadOver the years there have been many academic studies, government policies, non-governmental organizations (NGO) reports, industrial plans, and others all focusing on ways to improve the management of water and reduce inefficient water use over time - and yet we are still faced with the problem of a looming global water crisis. So why haven’t we solved this problem? The main reason is that we are terrible at managing this resource.In the last decade there have been improvements to the use of water resources; however, there are still an estimated 800 million people who do not have access to clean water and some 4 billion people who live under water scarcity at least one month per year. Several regions are also depleting their freshwater resources at a very fast pace — many major river basins in both developed and developing countries, are facing extremely high levels of water stress. Water is badly managed in many of these places. It is underpriced, subsidized and in some cases given away for free. In many regions the unsustainable water use is usually acknowledged when a crisis occurs such as a flood or drought. A typical example of this is in California, the over-abstraction of groundwater has been largely ignored, until a drought hits the region, costing the state approximately $2.7 billion per year. Unmanaged water-related risks such as floods and droughts can cost an economy billions of dollars, not to mention the tragic loss of life. Water is vital not only for the production of food, but also for energy production, for the extraction of materials, to maintain aquatic ecosystem services, for the livelihoods of people, and not least for the economy. Despite only accounting for just under 4% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014, the agriculture sector consumes the majority of the world’s freshwater resources (estimated at 70%), against 23% for industry and 8% for municipal use.Business as usual cannot continue — the global demand for water is expected to nearly double over the next 15 years.",481
177,"With dwindling supplies in many regions this could turn into a global water crisis affecting communities, industries, food production and the environment. There are, however, a number of solutions available which, in the words of Professor Keith Richards, should be ‘sustainable, collaborative and adaptive’.Investment in well-needed infrastructure is one part of the solution. On a global level, a total of $7.5 to $9.7 trillion is needed in investment for water and sanitation and related equipment. In developed countries investment is needed to upgrade and maintain aging infrastructure, while in developing countries investment is needed to build new infrastructure. Other solutions include pricing water efficiently, developing tradable permits to encourage efficient allocation of water and adequate regulation. Technology also has an important role to play — for example, smart meters encourage users to understand their consumption practices and precision agriculture is enabling farmers to collect real time data on weather, soil, and crop maturity.There isn’t a shortage of available solutions. Finding the right solution is a matter of good governance, and choosing a mix of solutions that works for your local community. It is, however, imperative that we do get it right this time as otherwise we will be sleepwalking into a global water crisis.Authors: Elizabeth Curmi, PhD.,Edward L Morse,Willem Buiter,Aakash Doshi,Dr. Richard Fenner,Adriana Knatchbull-Hugessen,Eric G Lee,Elaine Prior,Professor Keith Richards,Patrick Yau, CFA,Anthony Yuen,Click here to view the report in full.CommoditiesInvestmentSri SeriesWaterUP NEXTArticleUnited Nations Sustainable Development GoalsCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleRethinking Single-Use PlasticsCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoEnergy Darwinism IICiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",418

The Strategic Benefits of Funding Pensions Today - Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle22 Jun 2017The Strategic Benefits of Funding Pensions TodayCiti GPS Opinion ArticleCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareAfter years of low interest rates, corporate pension plans globally remain significantly underfunded. In Europe, the median STOXX 600 plan’s funded status was 73 percent at year-end 2016. In the U.S., the median S&P 1500 plan’s funded status was 76 percent, with one-third of the plans below 70 percent. Unrealized expectations of higher rates have increased the pressure to proactively address pension underfunding rather than hope for higher rates and equity prices to eliminate the deficit.Companies’ financial incentives to fund their plans are stronger than ever before. In the U.S., in particular, rising pension insurance premiums and the possibility of tax reform have dramatically increased the financial benefits from funding the deficit. Many companies have taken note and made large, often debt-funded, contributions to their plans as DuPont and Delta did in 2017.In addition to the direct financial benefits, pension funding can also help achieve multiple strategic corporate finance objectives, including enhancing valuations, facilitating strategic transactions, increasing financial flexibility, and decreasing risk.Strategic BenefitsA smaller pension deficit may improve the plan sponsor’s M&A prospects. Large pension liabilities create uncertainty for a potential acquirer, especially when they are not fully funded. In our analysis of S&P 1500 firms since 2005, we found that companies with large deficits were almost 25 percent less likely to be acquired than those with small deficits (or no pension obligations at all). Specifically, the likelihood of being acquired in a given year was 2.9 percent for companies whose pension deficit (as a fraction of total assets) was in the top quartile of their industry peers, while it was 3.8 percent for the bottom quartile. Academic research has found similar effects for U.K. companies.Companies with smaller pension deficits receive higher premiums when they are acquired. Our analysis also shows that, on average, companies with large pension deficits received takeover premiums that were 18 percent lower than those of companies with small deficits.",473
179,"Compared to the unaffected stock price one day prior to announcement, companies with large deficits received an average premium of 25 percent, compared with 30 percent for companies with small deficits.Large pension liabilities can add substantial complexity to M&A transactions. Additional regulatory approvals and the valuation of pension assets and liabilities introduce more layers of due diligence. This is especially true in cross-border transactions with multiple pension plans in different jurisdictions, each subject to its own regulations, actuarial methods, and demographic dynamics. Pension liabilities can be costly to evaluate and the acquirer may have less information than the seller on value-relevant information such as employee mobility and longevity. Pension regulators may also step in to block or influence particular transactions. In the U.K., the Conservative Party’s election platform calls for giving the pension regulator broader powers to impose conditions on (or even block) M&A transactions. Reflecting these complexities, our analysis shows that the time from announcement to closing was, on average, 20 percent longer for acquisitions of companies with pension plans.Pension deficits can limit a company’s financial flexibility, impairing its ability to grow. A drop in interest rates or stock prices can lead to an increase in the deficit, limiting a company’s financial flexibility and ability to invest in its business. In our analysis, we also found that companies with large pension deficits were less likely to acquire other companies and tended to invest less than companies with small deficits. Funding the pension also facilitates de-risking through asset allocation or outright transfer of the plan to an insurer.A large pension deficit can be a drag on valuation. We find that companies with large pension deficits suffered, on average, a valuation discount, in part reflecting the strategic disadvantages listed above. Companies with pension deficits (as a percentage of total assets) in the top quartile relative to their industry peers trade, on average, at a firm value-to-EBITDA multiple that is 0.4 lower than those in the bottom quartile. We also find that companies with large pension deficits experienced substantially lower shareholder returns over the last 10 years.In addition to the strategic benefits, funding the pension plan also offers a significant direct financial benefit. This benefit has rarely been greater than it is today.Why Fund Today?Pension insurance premium rates are higher than ever. Pension benefits in the U.S. are partially guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). In return, the PBGC charges plan sponsors a mandatory premium that is proportional to the funding deficit.",499
180,"This premium has increased from 0.9 percent of the deficit in 2013 to 3.4 percent in 2017, and is scheduled to increase to 4.1 percent by 2019. These increases have made waiting for higher interest rates or a further rally in stock prices far more expensive than it was in the past. We estimate that PBGC premium savings alone account for over $65 million of the net present value (NPV) of contributing $500 million to a representative underfunded pension plan today, rather than contributing later.Investment income on pension contributions is tax-free. Defined-benefit pension plans in the U.S. (and many other jurisdictions) offer a tax shelter, in that assets inside the plan grow tax-free, while the interest cost of funding a contribution is tax-deductible. This means that a hypothetical A-rated company can, quite literally, borrow at an annual rate of 1.95 percent (3.00 percent less 35 percent tax), contribute the proceeds to its pension plan and invest them in A-rated bonds, and earn tax-free interest at an annual rate of 3.00 percent. For our representative plan, we estimate an NPV of $17 million from this benefit alone.8 This tax benefit remains relevant for those plans that are fully funded from a PBGC premium perspective, but not fully funded on an actuarial basis.Tax reform could sharply curtail the tax benefits of later contributions. The prospect of a lower corporate tax rate (if U.S. tax reform comes to pass) creates another benefit that is unique to today’s environment. A lower future tax rate creates a large advantage to contributing to a pension plan while the contribution still generates a deduction at a rate of 35 percent, rather than making it in later years at a lower rate. We estimate that the NPV of fully closing a $500 million gap today would jump from $81 million to $160 million if the corporate tax rate falls to 20 percent in 2019.8Two arguments are often made against pension funding.“Rising interest rates will solve the problem.” Some corporates still hold out hope that rising interest rates will close (or at least narrow) the funding gap. In our view, however, rising rates are unlikely to solve most companies’ underfunding problem. For the median S&P 1500 pension plan to become fully funded, we estimate that rates would have to rise by 300 basis points.",499

Sustainable Cities- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesArticle27 Apr 2018Sustainable CitiesBeacons of Light Against the Shadow of Unplanned UrbanizationCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadAs Theodore Parker once said, ""Cities have always been the fireplaces of civilization, whence light and heat radiated out into the dark."" While great cities have shaped our civilizations over the millennia, sucking in resources both natural and human before radiating hem out to the world through commerce and culture, this received wisdom that 'cities are the engines of growth' is, we believe, failing.Cities may generate 80% of global GDP currently, but while they have historically pulled in resources as they grew via industrialization, this phase of urbanization is being driven as much by populations being pushed into cities by rural poverty and deprivation. This switch to 'growth being the engine of cities' has profound implications: it is the people that need the city, not the city that needs the people.Some 4 billion people, representing 54% of the global population currently live in cities; the UN expects this to grow by 1 billion by 2030, and 2 billion by 2050, by which time 66% of us will be living in cities. To put that in context, that is one and a half extra 'China's' or 'India's', or six extra 'USA's' all living in cities over the next 30 years. Cities may only occupy 2% of our global landmass, but they already consume 75% of all global resources and generate 70% of direct CO2 emissions. These new urban populations will require basic services such as water, energy, sanitation, food, and housing, as well as the 'luxuries' of employment, education, culture, and recreation. What impact will an extra 2 billion people add?The challenge though is even greater than this. Of our 2 billion new urbanites, 1.2 billion will come from Asia, and 800 million from Africa. These cities already have chronically limited revenue bases and offer meager services even to those already living there.",462
182,"With the lack of accompanying economic growth and financial contribution from this new populous, how can cities finance the vast investment needed to accommodate them? If these rapidly growing cities cannot finance themselves through income, and if central governments will not contribute more, then the capital must come externally.And so with challenge comes opportunity. The good news is that trillions of dollars in capital is looking to invest in long-dated, income-generating assets, especially if they are sustainability focused. And what an opportunity! In our Citi GPS report Infrastructure for Growth from October 2016, we estimated that global infrastructure spend to 2040 was $58.6 trillion, with the bulk of that urban — but cities are not just about physical infrastructure, they are about people, and hence there is a similarly vast 'social' spending opportunity.So how do we make it happen? In this report we contrast the vicious and virtuous circles of urban investment, and set out our 'Seven Steps for Sustainable Cities', which examine how cities can make the most of the money which they have, and gain access to greater funding via innovative new financial structures.Those seven steps will require central governments, industry, the financial community, and cities to all do their part to tackle what is one of the greatest challenges of the coming decades. With much of the infrastructure yet to be built, and with a typical life span of 30 -100 years, our choices now may resonate over centuries; we have the opportunity to reshape our future, by creating new and sustainable cities which can once again operate as 'beacons of light' radiating out into the world, or we can let the darkness of unplanned urban squalor continue to sprawl.",341

This report is the third in a long-term series of Citi GPS reports co-produced by Citi and the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford in order to explore some of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century. The report further explores the concepts introduced in our February 2015 report, Technology at Work: The Future of Innovation and Employment, which marked the introduction of the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment, a long-term program of research at the University of Oxford supported by Citi that will focus on the implications of a rapidly changing technological landscape for economies and societies.In this new report, Oxford Martin School academics; Dr. Carl Benedikt Frey, Associate Professor Michael Osborne and Dr. Craig Holmes expand their theories on the changing nature of innovation and work and the associated implications for the future of employment and society more widely. Based on their methodology that predicted 47 percent of U.S. jobs were at risk from automation, the authors now look at the probabilities of jobs at risk across the world as well as the disparities of job risk between cities.To protect against jobs being eliminated due to automation, it is important to recognize which characteristics are most likely to be associated with a given job being automated — perception and manipulation, creative intelligence, and social intelligence are the three bottlenecks to automation. Cities and regions that have invested in skilled industries remain relatively safe from automation and technological dynamism will remain the best way to maximize employment and to benefit positively from new technologies. Education is also a very important tool that policymakers will need to leverage in preparation for the effects of accelerated technological change.Throughout this report, Citi Research analysts drill deeper into specific industries to highlight a number of sectors already feeling the effects of automation as well as areas where technology is helping to create new jobs.

As we have shown in previous reports, 47% of jobs in the United States are at risk of automation over the forthcoming decades and similar shares have been estimated for other countries. This means the effects of the digital revolution are yet to be seen. In a recent interview in April 2017, Jack Ma, founder and Chairman of Alibaba, expects “decades of pain” as the Internet disrupts traditional businesses leading to “all sorts of industries and walks of life.”This report, the third in the Technology at Work series, focuses on the automation driven by e-Commerce for physical goods. We look at the technology needed to automate order fulfillment, inventory management, and delivery when consumers shop online and examine the implications in a wide range of areas for industry, retailers, supply chains, real-estate, and transportation, looking too at the impact on labor and employment.Growth in e-Commerce is the main driver of warehouse automation, a driver which itself will increase with broadband and mobile device penetration. In Japan, 32% of all goods bought on the Internet were bought on smartphones in 2016, up from 27% a year earlier. Millennials, those most likely to shop online, will soon enter their peak spending years. Global e-Commerce sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 20% over the last decade, and online retail sales have gone from ~2% of total to ~8%%.While technology is not yet either capable or cost effective in all cases, this is likely to change. Our estimates show that that 80% of jobs in transportation, warehousing, and logistics are susceptible to automation as a consequence of the trends we observe in technology. Retail is one industry in which employment is likely to vanish, but unlike manufacturing jobs which are highly concentrated, the downfall of retail employment will affect every city and region. U.S.",475
186,"companies employ 2 million people just to do stock and order fulfillment work and over 90% of warehouse picking is currently done by hand. Migrating to automated picking gives productivity gains of 2x–3x that as compared to pick-to-conveyor operations and 5x–6x as compared to manual pick-to-pallet fulfillment centers.The adoption of technology is by no means uniform. While one-hour delivery is available when buying online in some parts of the U.S. and Europe, the average promised delivery time in Brazil is nine days. While e-Commerce penetration is 87% in the U.K., it is only 18% in Romania. By end industry, penetration is highest in clothing and sporting goods.The virtual world is also subject to physical constraints. Warehouse availability is now at an all-time low in the U.S. and land availability for warehouses is already a problem in London, where 60%–70% of industrial sites sold are “lost” to residential development. Online business models need 300% more warehousing space compared to store-based fulfillment. Based on forecasts from Euromonitor for global e-Commerce growth, over 2.3 billion square feet of new warehousing space will be required by 2035. Road traffic is a challenge too — kilometers traveled by light goods vehicles in the U.K. were 47% higher in 2015 compared to 2000, while kilometers traveled by passenger cars were only 5% higher.Authors: Martin Wilkie,Carl Benedikt Frey,Chinchih Chen,Ji Cheong,Nick Coulter,Dan F Homan,Mark May,Graeme McDonald,Paola Mello,Masashi Miki, CFA,Anthony Moulder,Gareth M Phillips,Alicia Yap, CFA,Click here to view the report in full.AutomationEcommerceOnlineTechnologyTechnology At Work SeriesUP NEXTArticleTechnology at Work v4.0Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleTechnology at WorkCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleTechnology at Work v2.0Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",478

Winston Churchill once commented “if you don’t take change by the hand, it will take you by the throat.” The opportunities and risks multiply in our era of rapid change, driven by a hyper connected and digitizing world that is too fast for many.When Citi and the Oxford Martin School co-wrote the first Technology at Work Citi GPS report in 2015 it highlighted how technology, including automation, robotics, digitization and AI, was sweeping through many industries, but with it came a growing risk to jobs — Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne’s analysis at the Oxford Martin School highlighted that 47% of U.S. employment was susceptible to automation and has been called one of the most influential studies of our time. By the time Technology at Work 2 had been written in 2016, we (together with the World Bank) identified employment risks averaged 57% in the OECD, including India at 69% and China at 77%. Many articles and books since than have warned about this growing threat and it’s easy to see automation impacting jobs all around us, yet a decade on from the Great Financial Crisis we have record high employment levels across many OECD countries. So is the fear over-hyped? As the next generation prepares to enter the world of work, are there also big employment opportunities to offset the risks? As Carl explains in the first chapter of this report, while history has shown progress creates as well as destroys jobs, the process can be very difficult for large parts of society for a very long time. Carl tackles this with great insight in his new book The Technology Trap: Capital, Labor, and Power in the Age of Automation. An additional problem during technological revolutions is it can be easier to see risks to current jobs than to predict jobs yet to be invented. This report is designed to help provide a clearer vision of what could be an uncertain employment future.",468
188,"On a sector and economy basis, Citi experts, whose job it is to help investors predict and influence the future, provide their thoughts on the job and skill trends ahead and on changes, risks, and opportunities. Chapter 3 provides a unique collection of advice. We borrow from Isaac Newton “If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.” What better way to be informed about what the future will look like than hear from some of the leaders who are inventing it. This includes: 12 CEOs from around the world; several experts on innovation; the U.K. MP for Skills and Apprenticeships; one of the leading educators in China; the former Minister for Universities and Science in the U.K.; the former Treasury Secretary of the U.S. and other leading economists; leaders of foundations; experts in diversity and inclusion; and several authors of related books on this topic. We are extremely grateful to this extraordinary group of experts who have provided their wisdom because they care about helping the next generation and finding solutions. The other good news is that plenty of solutions do exist, unlike the first industrial revolution, most people now have the ability to vote for the society they want to live in. Since the industrial revolution, GDP has risen over 100 fold and innovation has brought huge progress in health, prosperity, and betterment of life. In a 2016 survey, we found 76% of investors surveyed described themselves at techno-optimists, but many were also understandably techno-anxious in this era of disruptive innovation.

This was pre-Internet and pre-email – we received annual reports from corporates through the mail, stored them in file cabinets and compiled information for research reports through hours of phone calls and trips to the corporate library. The introduction of the World Wide Web was like hiring an extra assistant to help get the job done — information was just a click away on a search engine, eliminating the need for the daily search through the reference book stacks.""These are the players with or without a scorecard - in one corner a machine, and in the other one Wallace V. Whipple, man. And the game, it happens to be the historical battle between flesh and steel, between the brain of man and the product of man's brain. We all may book on this one and predict no winner, but we can tell you for this particular contest, there is standing room only, in the twilight zone."" — Rod SerlingIn the world of manufacturing, the majority of automation to date has been viewed as something that helped get the job done more efficiently. The Industrial Revolution created vast employment for low-skilled workers with the adoption of the assembly line and workers adapted by making their skills complementary to the arrival of new technologies. Despite an increasing amount of automation being added to the factory floor over the past two decades, humans are still required to work with the robots and in most cases still do the final assembly.But this time is different. Recent technological developments have been helpful to workers and consumers, but the economic benefits of these developments haven’t been widely shared. Productivity has increased globally but real median wages have stagnated in many OECD countries leading to significant declines in labor's share of GDP. Inequality has widened, with the top 1% income share more than doubling in the past three decades amid a decline in employment in traditional middle-income jobs accompanied by a structural shift in the labor market.",477
190,"Workers have reallocated to low-income jobs hitherto less susceptible to automation, further worsening income inequality.The upcoming digital age may cause more upheaval than previous technological revolutions as it is happening faster than before and is fundamentally changing the way we live and work. Technology in the 21st century is enabling the automation of tasks once thought quintessentially human: cognitive tasks involving subtle and non-routine judgment. Through big data, the digitization of industries, the Internet of Things and industrial and autonomous robots, the world around us is changing rapidly as is the nature of work across occupations, industries and countries. Although we can’t predict exactly which jobs will be affected, we do have a reasonably good idea about the type of tasks computers will be able to perform in the near future. Based on this, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne predict that 47% of the U.S. workforce is at high risk of automation as a result of these trends and low-income and low-skill jobs are now, for the first time, most likely to be automated.In order to avoid disruption and upheaval from the digital age, countries need to understand the direction and pace of technological change and plan for the long term.

191,"global insights citigps telecom structural separation right response new digital era challenges 2. Is Telecom Structural Separation the Right Response to New Digital Era Challenges? - CitiGPSOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle03 Jun 2015Is Structural Separation the Right Response to New Digital Era Challenges?Citi GPS Opinion ArticleCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsContributor(s):  Dalibor Vavruska(Global Head of Digital Connectivity Strategy & Head of CEEMEA Telecom Research)ShareLast month, we brought a group of investors to meet the CEO of O2 Czech Republic, the world’s first integrated incumbent telecom operator to choose to structurally separate its infrastructure from its service business. Although the concept of infrastructure separation in telecoms and utilities is not new and global experience, for example from the UK and New Zealand telecoms, suggests that fears of value loss from such moves may be exaggerated, no incumbent other than O2 Czech Republic has yet chosen to voluntarily become a ‘digital service company’, spinning off its entire basic telecom infrastructure into a separate legal entity (‘the infrastructure company’). The separated assets include fixed-line access network, fiber backbone, mobile towers, and mobile radio equipment.Although there is no immediate plan for the private controlling shareholder to cease control in either of the two companies, those companies may have different shareholder bases, the service company will be managed on an arms-length basis, and future control changes cannot be ruled out. The only reason why management decided to implement such a model is because it believes that in the context of present and future regulatory trends in the Czech Republic — a European Union member country — this move will create value for shareholders.In this note we look at a shareholder value creation case from voluntary (i.e. shareholder and management-driven) structural separation in telecoms. Since regulation is the crucial driver, we first outline our high-level thoughts about technology, media & telecom (TMT) regulation.The key question in TMT regulation: When should superior returns be tolerated?The desire to generate superior returns by building a sustainable competitive advantage is the key driver of most free-market enterprises. Success in building such advantages, however, naturally creates quasi-monopolies, which may curtail free competition. For example, mobile operators with superior networks, unless those are fully open, are in fact lightly regulated quasi-monopolistic high-end service providers.",483
192,"Scale economies have always made TMT industries prone to creating such quasi-monopolies with superior returns. Policymakers sometimes tolerate them on the basis of broader economic and society interests such as:1. Support for innovation in order to boost local economies and their global competitiveness.2. Revenue extraction from the industry for governments and for good causes (e.g. taxes, licence fees, dividends, or donations).3. Support for basic infrastructure investments, for example into mobile and fiber networks.Successful innovation requires the best talent and capital willing to take high risk, both of which are difficult to attract without opportunities to be rewarded with superior returns. Hence, as with intellectual property, we think that the benefits of innovation may in some cases justify tolerance of superior returns.Whether such superior returns should also be tolerated in order to extract revenue for state budgets is a political question. On the one hand, it is possible to see the political appeal of conducting highly competitive spectrum tenders to raise substantial revenue as opposed to, for example, hiking general taxes. On the other hand, tolerance of superior returns for this purpose tends to lead to economic inefficiencies and conflicts of interest. Conceptually, special industry taxes or fees should, in our view, be linked to specific externalities such as environmental impact of the business. In such cases, they can be treated as a cost to the industry with no need to tolerate superior returns for selected operators.Finally, the concept of tolerating superior returns to encourage investment in basic (utility-like) infrastructure may, in our view, not be economically efficient. Such investments, which often involve significant scale economies but limited innovation, may be better approached by allowing infrastructure consolidation. Dominant infrastructure companies could then be regulated, similar to utilities, using a Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model, which allows fair return on investments into basic infrastructure and gives regulators tools to encourage investment. Which part of telecom infrastructure should be seen as the ‘basic utility’ for this purpose, however, remains a major question.Opportunities for TMT innovation have changed, giving regulators new incentive to promote competition in innovative digital services and tolerate consolidation in basic infrastructure.Innovation opportunities in TMT are clearly evolving.",439
193,"Rapid developments in the Internet industry over the past ten years, along with future opportunities in interactive video content, Internet of Things, e-health, e-finance, robotics, artificial intelligence and similar areas, have arguably shifted opportunities to innovate from basic infrastructure, such as towers and fiber networks, to a diverse area of digital services. Although most of the innovative third-party digital services running on telecom operators’ networks are yet to be developed, some of them already exist. Services such as connected cars, Apple’s Soft SIM, Amazon’s Kindle, Google’s mobile service Fi in the US, and Sky’s interactive TV and broadband services in the UK in our view indicate future trends in the industry. We have also addressed this topic in our GPS reports ""Re-birth of telecom monopoly: Is the industry broken and heading towards its monopolistic roots?"" from November 2014 and ""Is the current telecom regulation helping economic growth?"" from February 2015.We think that in their effort to promote innovation, regulators may in the future become more lenient towards companies attempting to build a sustainable competitive advantage (and hence generate superior returns) in innovative digital services, particularly if these are local companies with potential to boost local employment, economic growth, and competitiveness of local economies in the global markets. Meanwhile, regulators may, in our view, have less tolerance for superior returns generated by lightly regulated vertically integrated fixed-line, mobile, or converged operators. This is because such infrastructure leadership could inhibit development of a diverse digital service economy by limiting the access of innovative digital service companies, including local ones, into top-class quality, but in its nature basic, infrastructure.Telecom infrastructure is sometimes described as the backbone of the digital economy. Leaving aside the fact that living organisms usually have one as opposed to several competing backbones, it is clear that a model of several overlapping infrastructure networks, which is prone to producing quasi-monopolistic ‘leaders’, is not the only way to encourage investment into basic infrastructure. Vertical integration is hardly the most efficient way to encourage diverse and innovative competition for digital service either. If regulators follow the above-mentioned concept, owning basic infrastructure could become a burden to generating high returns for the telecom operators as opposed to a differentiating factor. This may lead to a situation when structurally separating certain basic infrastructure assets becomes value accretive for telecom operators.What is structural separate of telecom operators?By structural separation we mean legal ownership separation, i.e.",487
194,"the disposal, of basic telecom infrastructure assets possibly including fixed-line access networks, fiber backbones, mobile towers, or mobile radio equipment etc. by major telecom operators. The trigger for such decisions is usually related to regulation in two possible ways. Firstly, operator management may conclude that given the regulatory outlook, ownership of some infrastructure assets does not form a basis for major competitive advantages anymore, while their disposals may boost returns and value. Secondly, the regulator could impose such structural separation by law.The former way, also called voluntary structural separation, gives the telecom operators a range of advantages. They could, for example, choose which assets they dispose depending on their view of future regulation, future competitive advantages, and other business reasons. They also determine the initial buyers of the infrastructure assets and potentially can benefit from leveraging the infrastructure company. However, each operator and market faces different conditions so there is no industry-wide answer about which assets should ideally be separated. Large numbers of mobile operators have, for example, already chosen to dispose of some or all of their towers or they are contemplating such a move. While large telecom operators have so far been mostly reluctant to voluntarily separate their infrastructure assets, there are examples of newly established infrastructure/wholesale-only local fiber companies in Europe and Asia.The latter way, also called involuntary structural separation, is based on a legislative process aimed at forcefully breaking up the telecom operators to create open basic infrastructure networks, like in the fixed-line case in New Zealand. Policy-makers, who support this approach, believe that open networks are superior for the broader economy and for the consumer. Out of the major regions, the European Union appears ideologically closest to the open network concept. The European Commission (EC), for example, enforced similar involuntary structural separation in the electricity industry in 2006 on the basis this would prevent the industry suffering from vertical integration. The EC has also been focused on creating and regulating telecom wholesale markets and opening passive telecom infrastructure more persistently than regulators in most other regions. In 2006, the UK functionally separated its incumbent fixed-line network (i.e., separated operations without ownership change). In our view, the EC sees open infrastructure as being supportive of its ultimate objective of creating European common markets in electricity, digital services, etc. Creation of the Digital Single Market is No. 2 on the EU’s current top ten priorities list.",473
195,"All that said, there are currently no proposals to enforce structural separation in European telecoms by law, and we do not expect this to change very soon. Apart from a lack of consensus on this issue, we believe structural separation is much harder to design and enforce for telecoms than it is for utilities, for example, because definition of basic infrastructure is more ambiguous in telecoms.Cutting the Gordian knot: Why some telecom inclumbents may choose to structurally separate voluntarilyLet’s now think about whether other incumbents in Europe and globally could follow O2 Czech Republic’s lead and voluntarily separate some, or all, of their infrastructure. Regulation is without doubt the key factor in such decisions. Even without enforcing involuntary structural separation by law, regulators can encourage voluntary structural separation by promoting open access infrastructure, allowing infrastructure consolidation, and promoting innovative competition for digital services, for example. Operators with independent and rational controlling shareholders in markets where one can reasonably assume that regulators would behave in the described way may start seeing the following value accretive benefits in voluntary structural separation:• Freedom from regulation and lower legal risk. The idea behind structural separation is that the service company, which is freed from owning infrastructure, should also be freed from most telecom regulation. It should, for example, be able to bundle digital and other services and products. Such commercial freedom is a crucial condition for successful innovation. Meanwhile, lack of restrictive regulation also reduces legal risks faced by the operators.• Superior strategy based on simplicity. Separating the infrastructure and service simplifies business models of the telecom operators, giving the two separated companies the opportunity to develop clearer and simpler strategies and corporate culture than vertically integrated operators would have. This can lead to better execution, management motivation, and ultimately increased overall efficiency.• M&A, funding and financial engineering. Each of the two separated companies has an opportunity to better focus its M&A strategy as well as find more suitable funding to match its business model (cheap long-term infrastructure capital, government infrastructure subsidies, growth-focused capital, etc.). The infrastructure company may in many cases have the opportunity to create equity value through taking additional leverage.• Infrastructure consolidation. The separated model may benefit from higher regulatory tolerance of in-market consolidation in infrastructure.• First-mover and flexibility benefits.",449
196,"Telecom operators, which choose to voluntarily structurally separate their infrastructure in an early stage, may enjoy a first-mover advantage in building their digital services business as well as some degree of flexibility to choose which strategic assets they keep in the unregulated service company and who will initially own the infrastructure company.Why have most telecoms so far resisted voluntary structural separation?Telecom executives usually see fundamental industry challenges ahead, which among other things, drive the current M&A activity in the industry. However, a view that voluntary structural separation is the right strategic response has so far been rare. After all, structural separation in its extreme form means the end of the telecom industry as we know it today. This would be followed by the emergence of a utility-type infrastructure industry and a riskier, but also more innovative, digital services industry. Each of these industries may need different management focus and different types of investors. It is clear that supporting structural separation would require a high degree of risk taking (by the current operators' management and shareholders) as well as strong interest alignment between management and shareholders. Such a move also needs to be based on a conviction that it is in the best interest of shareholders. Finding examples of major telecom operators which fulfil all these criteria has so far been difficult. Some operators are taking a view that moves less radical than ownership separation are more appropriate. Such models include, for example, imposing internal barriers within the existing incumbent operators similar to those applied at BT and its fully owned infrastructure division Openreach.Many telecom executives believe that sustainable network advantages also bring superior returns in the service business — in other words they see synergies between owning the network and providing services on it. Moreover, many vertically integrated operators believe that they deserve special regulatory treatment, for example because they are helping to generate a special tax or dividend revenue for the government or they lead strategically important infrastructure investment projects in their countries. Under the current regulation, it is hard to disregard such arguments in most countries.Furthermore, telecom executives may be concerned about the duplication-driven cost increase caused by structural separation as well as the risks of not identifying the right assets for the separation, execution risks, negative perception of the separation by largely dividend-focused investors, and potential regulatory risk (e.g. regulators failing to free up the service companies from regulation) as well as major competitive, commercial and strategic risks facing the service companies. Any case for voluntary structural separation hence needs to be strongly justified by confidence that the new regulatory environment will be supportive of it.",499
197,"We think that most large telecom operators currently do not have such confidence.Change of mindset: From complexity to simplicity; from risk aversion to taking risk for a rewardThe most successful TMT companies such as Apple and Google have several things in common, but two stand out. Firstly, despite their technological sophistication, their products and pricing tend to be relatively simple. They also have the ability to constantly innovate and at some point totally reinvent their products. Secondly, with their focus on a small number of simple-to-use products, they often take significant commercial risks. Vertically integrated telecom incumbents and large mobile operators have historically approached their business differently. Their product offerings have often been quite complex, and risk aversion has usually played a major role in their business strategies. This should not be surprising given the fact that most investors see telecoms as dividend yielding low-risk utility-like companies. Moreover, a significant number of telecom operators worldwide have large free floats (i.e. risk averse dividend-focused investors are important for them) and direct or indirect government-related major shareholders. This naturally discourages them from taking excessive business risk including moves such as structural separation, even if potential returns were high.That said regulators in countries such as New Zealand and the UK have already enforced structural and functional separation of telecom infrastructure based on principal reasons. We have also already mentioned private companies in Europe and Asia rolling out fiber as a pure wholesale infrastructure-only business, and Apple’s soft SIM, Google’s Fi, or Amazon’s Kindle are high-profile examples of the concept of separated infrastructure and service. The most basic form of structural separation, disposals of mobile towers, is already wide-spread and is gaining further momentum globally.In our view, the best conditions under which structural separation of major telecom operators may create value for shareholders are as follows:• Pro-separation regulation. Regulators would need to clearly demonstrate their desire to turn basic telecom infrastructure into an open access utility in order to encourage the most effective competition in innovative digital services, ideally with a bias toward supporting innovative local service companies by giving the successful ones an opportunity to generate superior returns.• Privately controlled operators. Telecom operators controlled by private entities, not directly linked with governments or other operators’ interests, are in our view more likely to show flexibility and take the risks necessary for adopting new business models.• Simple operators and telecom markets in smaller countries without excessively complicated legal framework.",477

The Creator EconomyOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountCiti's 10th Digital Money Symposium 2023Article06 Mar 2023The Creator EconomyGetting Creative and GrowingCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadThe internet and smartphones have changed content generation from a central model to one that's more distributed. This distributed model allows for more ""niche"" content to be produced, leading to a ""creator economy."" We find that net revenues to the creator are inversely related to the number of creators on a platform, making the creator economy highly concentrated. New tools and platforms utilizing Web 3.0 and AI could help creators increase their revenue.For over 600 years, innovations spawned new forms of entertainment. The printing press (invented around 1436) unleashed book publishing. Later, radio and movies (1895), TV (1927), and video games (1958) sprung onto the scene. However, amidst all this innovation, one thing remained constant: Content creation was both curated and centralized. With the advent of the internet and smartphones, social media was born. For the first time, content creation was no longer centralized. It was distributed. As such, gatekeepers — like studio heads or masthead editors — were no longer required. Crucially, however, social media platforms — like Meta or TikTok — did not share the spoils with the content creators. They kept all the revenues for themselves.  This is beginning to change. Across industries — publishing, podcasting, esports, and education — content creators are finding ways to monetize their content directly with their fans. This new ecosystem is often called the creator economy. While it barely existed five years ago, today there are over 120 million content creators. In 2022, we expect the creator economy to generate about $60 billion of revenue per year with ~9% growth per year through 2024 when it may approach $75 billion of revenue. Around half of the revenues stem from ad-based video platforms, like YouTube. The other half is spread across a wide array of industries: publishing, education, and podcasting, among others. The creators do need help, and platforms can assist. However, the platforms charge fees that can vary from less than 10% of creator’s revenues (Patreon, Spotify, and Unity) to as high nearly 85% (Roblox).",499
200,"The variance often depends on the value the platform provides across five functions: (1) creation, (2) hosting, (3) distribution, (4) promotion, and (5) monetization. The more functions these platforms perform, the higher the fees. Today, the creator economy is diverse, vibrant, and growing. However, across many of the creator economy platforms, a similar pattern emerges. The lion’s share of the revenue is captured by a very small portion of the content creators. Far more than 80% of the revenues are created by far fewer than 20% of the creators. In short, the Pareto principle, or 80/20 rule, does not apply. The creator economy is “winner takes most.” Going forward, we think there are three areas worth watching. First, traditional social media firms may begin to share some of the spoils with content creators. That is, platforms like Twitter may begin to emulate YouTube’s business model. Or, as Instagram and Facebook push further into e-commerce, they will create opportunities for content creators to share in the economic spoils. Second, Web 3.0 may create opportunities for creator economy platforms to leverage augmented reality, blockchain, crypto, and NFTs to alter the economics of the creator economy. These tools can help facilitate a direct relationship between content creators and fans with a diminished role for digital intermediaries. In short, Web 3.0 may help improve the economics of content creators. Third, artificial intelligence may alter the creator economy in several ways including by helping with content creation and helping brands find the right influencer or helping consumer find the right content. It will be interesting to watch. With that, let’s dig into the details.From Central to DistributedThe rise of the internet and smartphones has shifted the supply of entertainment from being centrally produced to a distributed model. This means creators are no longer focusing on the largest, most lucrative markets but instead can serve micro-markets and niches, leading to a “creator economy.”Creator Utilize Services to Generate Revenue Monetization in the creator economy comes from ads, subscriptions, donations, purchases, and sponsorship. The generate revenues, creators need help and often use large platform so assist in creation, hosting, distribution, promotion, and monetization.Winner Takes Most Services fees charged for creator services vary greatly by platform.",474

Beyond the obvious impact on their own lives, what benefits might almost a billion extra well-educated people bring to the world?The 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals aim to tackle the challenges, issues, and injustices facing the world by 2030, but the goals themselves are complex. They are arguably all inextricably linked, with numerous feedback loops, not all of them positive. Trillions of dollars of capital wants to invest sustainably but struggles to translate an investment philosophy, which desires alignment with the SDGs, into a practical investment strategy given that complexity.This report tries, as far as possible, to simplify the SDGs — to examine those interlinkages, to determine the driving forces and resulting benefits, and thereby determine a set of critical paths — our so-called 'pathways to success' — which can lead quickly and most effectively to the achievement of the goals. It allows us to identify who is best placed to do what, from the public sector to the private sector to the investment community, and what their route in might be.",471
202,"We examine the goals individually, attempting to lay out both the incremental financial cost/opportunity of achieving the goal, and the human benefit that might be gained by solving it. In a world of scarce resources, it also provides an indication of which paths might achieve the broadest human benefit for the least financial cost though this does not mean these are the most important — it is not by accident that all roads on our 'pathways to success' lead to the eradication of poverty.We identify incremental physical investment needs or opportunities in water, energy, and the circular economy alone of $1.5 trillion per year, while social investment areas of education, health, and hunger add up to an annual incremental opportunity of $800 billion. To be sure, these are enormous sums, but much smaller than the sums of capital looking to invest sustainably and tiny in relation to the human benefits that could be achieved. We also examine the innovative financial instruments and frameworks needed to allow that capital to flow to aid in the achievement of the goals.The SDGs represent the challenge of our generation but a challenge which we should embrace, as the benefits for those suffering most, as well as to the whole global community, would be immeasurable if we were to succeed. By identifying the lowest hanging fruit, the feedback loops, the critical paths, the scale of the opportunity in both human and financial terms, and who might do what, we hopefully break the sometimes daunting SDGs down into a roadmap — a framework which allows all elements of society, from policymakers, to corporates and the financial community, to set out in partnership down a pathway to a better, fairer, wealthier, more inclusive, cleaner, and more sustainable world that we can be truly proud to leave for our children.Authors: Jason Channell,Elizabeth Curmi, PhD.,Zoe Whitton,Tina M Fordham,Click here to view the report in full.FinancialHumanHuman OpportunityInvestmentSDGsSri SeriesWorldUP NEXTArticleRethinking Single-Use PlasticsCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoEnergy Darwinism IICiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsArticleFeeding the FutureCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",494

Unlocking Climate and Development FinanceOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountSustainability SeriesArticle01 Dec 2023Unlocking Climate and Development FinanceCreating Bankable ProjectsCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsShareDownload ReportOver the past decade, amazing progress has been made toward addressing climate change. In 2015, 196 parties adopted the breakthrough Paris Agreement at the COP15 meeting, creating a legally binding international treaty focused on keeping the rise in the mean global temperature below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. At the COP26 meeting in 2021, world leaders assembled again to lay out a global agenda for a path to net-zero emissions, and they established an actionable framework around the promises made in the Paris Agreement. Once the plan was put together, the next challenge was figuring out how to pay for global action on climate change. Between 2016 and 2020, climate-related projects mobilized between $600 billion and $900 billion on average annually. However, to reach the IEA Net Zero by 2050 Scenario, an estimated $125 trillion is required over the next 30 years. Despite global finance flows more than doubling in 2022 to $1.4 trillion from 2020, the estimated annual climate finance gap between 2030 and 2050 is nearly 7x 2022 flows. Investment progress in the energy transition is being made — in developed markets via private capital financing, and in emerging markets primarily from public sector capital and supranational organizations. To achieve already-established global climate goals, much of the climate finance in the coming decades will be in emerging markets. The challenge is to mobilize private capital with lower risk profiles to invest in higher-risk emerging markets that need funding for climate projects. In this report, we lay out a framework for the development of “bankable projects” that relies on stakeholders to building an understanding of the challenges facing each party by creating an enabling environment, looking at projects through an investment prism, developing a project lifecycle, and delivering successful outcomes. What this means in practice is each stakeholder doing their part to bring very much needed climate finance to emerging and developing markets. For public sector this means developing a stable and predictable political and economic backdrop while also intentionally setting a climate agenda.",471

Upwardly Mobile II - Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle27 Nov 2012Upwardly Mobile IIA Long and Winding Road for Mobile Payments - Eight Crucial Questions, AnsweredCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadMobile Payments has been dubbed the Future of Money and the conventional wisdom is that this is how we will transact in the years to come. When we analyzed the global Mobile Payments opportunity in our first  ""Citi GPS: UPWARDLY MOBILE "" report back in March 2012, we provided a good description of a variety of topics related to Mobile Payments. The past six months has been heavy with news flow indicating that there are now wider choices than before in Mobile Payment and these announcements have also given us better clarity on what can and cannot work. Subsequently, we’ve found that there is a need to address questions that go to the heart of what is changing within Payments. In this report, we focus on eight questions that address the issues of business model evolution, technology and adoption:  1. Processing ""Rails"" and Transactions – Do Mobile Payments alter the traditional 4-Party payments system? If yes how?   2. Incumbents and Their Actions – What are incumbent card networks doing to adapt to the rapid changes brought by Mobile Payments?   3. Targeted Offers and Data Ownership – How will the adjacent ""Targeted Offers"" market develop? Who owns the underlying data?   4. Ecosystem Evolution – What will the Mobile Payments ecosystem look like?   5. Technology Choice and Timeframe – Which technology is likely to win and become the global standard? Will it be the early leader, NFC (Near-Field Communications) or will cloud-based or other solutions win? When will the infrastructure be in place for widespread Mobile Payments?   6. Global Standards and Regulation – Will a global Mobile Payment standard emerge to address regulation, security and privacy concerns?   7. Mobile Wallet Attributes – What are the desirable attributes of a Mobile Wallet?   8. The Holy Grail: Consumer Adoption – What will drive consumer adoption? We find most importantly, that mobile payments could simplify and alter some elements of the traditional four-party payments system as information and interaction increase in importance, versus the actual payment transaction itself.",491
206,"The type and timing of technology is still not clear but what is clear is that in the last 6 months, new and credible non-NFC solutions have emerged. Infrastructure must be upgraded to enable Mobile Payments for any technology that becomes the global standard and the timeframe will be technology dependent. Merchants may very well wait until there is more clarity on technology before making investments towards adoption. Finally, we believe consumer adoption will depend on the presence of a “killer app” – an app that is simple for both consumers to adopt and use and is widely available.Although we are now able to hazard a guess at the lay-of-the-land for a future Mobile Payments ecosystem, we still look for a multi-year path to reasonably widespread adoption.",147

We assume the alarm clock will ring, the water in the shower will be hot, the car will start, the train will show up on time, the kids will call us at least once before they get on the school bus, we’ll arrive at the right location for our first marketing meeting and, if we’re lucky, might even have gotten to a new level on Candy Crush before we get there. In short, we’re taking it for granted how much of our eventful morning we owe to Mobility — smart electric meters, smart appliances, Connected Cars, rail safety systems, smartphones, navigation, and online gaming — all made possible because of the dramatic growth in the use of mobile computing and connectivity. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Paying for your Starbucks with your smartphone while reading a news report on a tablet after your Connected Car helped you avoid a traffic jam is a more obvious use of mobile, but with the integration of Mobility growing exponentially and across a many sectors, it will increasingly become the base of our daily living.In our first Upwardly Mobile report in March 2012, we looked at Mobile Payments and how this technology was a way to “change the payments world” in emerging markets and “change the payments experience” in developed markets. Our second report went a bit further and looked beyond just the Mobile Payment transaction and started to look at Mobile Payments as the facilitator of Mobile Commerce (M-Commerce). In this third report of the Upwardly Mobile series, we go further again and give thought to how Mobility is not just transforming our monetary transactions, but how it is being embedded in almost every industry through the shift of commerce from traditional and electronic to mobile (E2M), the increased use of telematics in vehicle and transportation applications or the introduction of Mobility into Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interactions. And when we started to look, we found the numbers were pretty staggering.",476
208,"Cisco forecasts the number of connected devices in the world will increase to 50 billion in 2020 from just 500 million in 2013. Mobile retail commerce in the U.S. rose 63% to $34 billion in 2013 and has risen to almost 13% of all E-Commerce sales, up from just 9% in 2012 and Amazon noted that half of their customers shopped using a mobile device during the 2013 holiday season in the U.S. Revenues in commercial fleet telematics are expected to rise nearly four-fold to ~$27 billion by 2018 and estimates for revenue in the M2M space range as high as $1.2 trillion by 2022. We were also surprised by the breadth of sectors that are being influenced by the proliferation of Mobility. In the same way that E-Commerce strategies were a ‘must have’ over the last few decades as the Internet came alive, the rise of M-Commerce is forcing corporations to shift their strategies to accommodate mobile. Telematics has moved beyond just GPS in a car, to rail safety and insurance pricing. In the M2M space, we found examples of Mobility in traditional manufacturing through areas such as robotics, process controls and white goods appliances, as well as in non-manufacturing sectors such as healthcare, mining, agriculture, utilities and home security. In each of the three Mobility verticals (E2M, Telematics and M2M), we explore not only the ‘use cases’ for Mobility and how each sector is implementing mobile solutions, but also identify the ‘enablers’ that will create the infrastructure for Mobility to be implemented.Click here to view the report in full.DisruptionMobile PaymentsMobilityUpwardly MobileUP NEXTArticleUpwardly Mobile IICiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoUpwardly MobileCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsVideoUpwardly MobileCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",450

Upwardly Mobile - Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountVideo09 Mar 2012Upwardly MobileAn Analysis of the Global Mobile Payments OpportunityCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownloadIn the good old days, your office couldn't reach you 24x7, Apples and Blackberries were found at fruit stands and you only came across an Android when you relaxed with a science fiction novel. Also, in the good old days, people drove in circles looking for an address or a payphone, they stood in line at the bank for every financial transaction and they ran from store to store searching for the best price. Today in most developed markets, you can not only place a call but with a couple of clicks on a mobile phone you can pay a bill, send money to a friend, search for the best bargain, donate money to charity and pay for practically anything. In emerging markets, consumers are finally being included in the formal financial system. Workers who are employed anywhere in the world can now text their wages back to family members at home and no longer have to travel hours at a time to pay utility bills.The meteoric rise in mobile phone subscriptions - now almost 6 billion worldwide - has transformed communication. It's not only about voice. Today's mobile phones can serve as a mobile payments platform or shopping mall. Mobile Payments touches a large number of industries. This is increasingly true in low-GDP countries and for lower-income consumers with basic phones.In emerging markets, mobile phone penetration now outpaces the availability of banking and other financial services, giving rise to the mobile phone as a portal for the provision of these services. Once consumers are comfortable with the concept of electronically stored monetary value, more advanced mobile banking functionality can be introduced. There are more than 125 Mobile Payments pilots in progress today. Successful deployments like M-PESA in Kenya have forged a path for others to follow, based on massive adoption of the platform, gaining 60% penetration of the country's adult population in just four years since being launched.In developed markets where access to financial services is more commonplace, the Mobile Payments opportunity is based more on providing feature-rich products that enhance the consumers' banking or shopping experience. Mobile commerce is already transforming the way consumers shop, blending of the online and off-line into a single homogenous view.",489
210,"Adoption will depend on using mobility to enhance the consumer's buying experience and leveraging mobile information to create additional consumer value.It's not just telecom providers and financial institutions, but an ecosystem that also involves consumers, private corporations, governments, retailers, technology companies and processors.In the report that follows, we look at what the Mobile Payments opportunity could be and examine the factors that contribute to a successful Mobile Payments ecosystem. We look closely at Japan and Kenya - two countries with leading Mobile Payment offerings - to help to provide a blueprint for how future offerings should be structured.

Video Games: Cloud Invaders- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle07 Jun 2019Video Games: Cloud Invaders Bracing for the Netflix-ization of GamingCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsShareDownloadExecutive SummaryWhat was your first memory of playing video games? Mine was playing Centipede at the local pizzeria. Armed with quarters and enough money for one slice of pizza, we would play until we were either broke or our fingers were sore from firing digital missiles. Eventually my friend got an Atari game system and after months of begging for the same, my Dad caved in and bought us a gaming system – an Intellivision game system. He told us over and over that it was a better system to Atari but it didn’t have all the cool games that my friends played. It was hard sometimes being the daughter of an engineer who cared about technology superiority, but at least the hockey game let you punch people.Game choices moved quickly after that – Tetris on my Macintosh Plus, Donkey Kong on my Nintendo DS, Brickbreaker on my Blackberry, and now Candy Crush on my iPhone. The common constraint through the years was that the games I played continued to be dependent on the device I owned.When the Internet came about, new firms started disrupting traditional media businesses such as newspapers, radio, and television by giving consumers what they wanted, when they wanted, and on the device they wanted. But it didn’t disrupt the video game industry. Game publishers were able to use the Internet to augment their revenues. They used the Internet to increase in-game sales and sell software directly to consumers, and tapped into the smartphone market and the growth of mobile gaming.Are video game publishers immune from disruptive threats? The authors of this report answer with a resounding no. There is a technology on the horizon that has all the characteristics of a disruptive threat to the video game ecosystems — the cloud.The video game ecosystem has been evolving over the last few years — towards group play vs. single play, to in-game monetization vs. software sales, to renting vs. buying hardware, to video games being a spectator sport, and to software being made for all devices vs. software made specifically for hardware.",468
212,"These new trends in the video game industry could make it much easier for the big cloud players to come in and start pulling away revenue.The cloud-based providers will be able to offer low-cost access to cloud-based gaming and a wide array of gaming content. They will also be able to monetize gaming in non-traditional ways that play to their strengths — through in-game monetization, in-game advertising, broadcasting, and digital. For consumers, cloud will make it easier to play games on different platforms and allow players to be device agnostic, hitting pause on a PC game and picking it up again on a mobile device.",125

Waiting and Waiting for the Global Renminbi-CitiGPSOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle20 Mar 2019Waiting and Waiting for the Global RenminbiCiti GPS Opinion ArticleCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsContributor(s):  David LubinShareDownload‘Great powers’, says the Nobel-laureate economist Robert Mundell, ‘have great currencies’. So where is China’s?In the years following Great Financial Crisis things seemed to be looking up for the renminbi. By the middle of 2015, almost 30 percent of China’s trade was being settled in renminbi; Hong Kong banks were holding some RMB 1 trillion worth of yuan-denominated deposits; and there was life in the Dim Sum bond market, with issuance running close to $10 billion per month. 2015 was also the year the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the renminbi would become one of currencies that underpin its own reserve asset, the Special Drawing Rights or SDR. Almost by definition, this step seemed to confer on the renminbi something like the status of a global reserve currency. So the renminbi seemed, to most observers, to be firmly on a path towards real international relevance.In the past three years, though, grounds for optimism about the renminbi’s global role have proved to be decidedly fragile. These days, the share of China’s trade that is settled in renminbi is less than half of what it was in 2015; the stock of yuan-denominated deposits has fallen to just over RMB 600 billion; and Dim Sum bond issuance late last year was down to $1 billion per month.It turns out that all the enthusiasm back then about the renminbi’s future was guilty of what philosophers call a ‘category-mistake’. What most people saw as evidence of the renminbi’s internationalization was, in fact, simply evidence of something else: an accumulation of speculative positions built on the expectation that renminbi was going to rise in value. As the renminbi weakened after mid-2015, so too did the market’s willingness to own it and use it.That’s hardly the mark of a global reserve currency.",470
214,"International investors want to own dollars or euros, for example, not just because they expect these currencies to strengthen, but because they offer legal security, ease of use and, critically, unrestricted convertibility into any other currency. And it is questions surrounding the renminbi’s full convertibility that are likely to stunt its growth as a global currency for the foreseeable future. It just happens to be a fact of life about the current international monetary system that the definition of a reserve currency implies a fully convertible one. The problem is that recent years have seen the Chinese government pivot away from the idea that the renminbi should be a fully convertible currency.Back in 2012, the ‘political report’ delivered at the Eighteenth Party Congress included a goal to “gradually realize capital account convertibility”. By 2017, though, officials had decided to drop any reference to capital account opening in the report to the Nineteenth Party Congress. This change of heart was captured neatly in 2015 by the then-People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who claimed that “the capital account convertibility that China is seeking to achieve is not based on the traditional concept of being fully or freely convertible”. Instead, he said, China would adopt a concept of “managed convertibility”.What “managed convertibility” means, above all, is that the Chinese authorities assert a right to use their discretion to make decisions about which kind of inflows and outflows are ‘good’, and which are ‘bad’. This assertion of the competence of policymakers seems to fit right in with what most people understand as a revival of the party-state under President Xi. And the use of this discretion was on full display in late 2016 and early 2017, when Chinese authorities imposed heavy restrictions on the outflow of capital from China. If anything, it seems that Chinese policymakers seem more interested in the internationalization of the renminbi than they are in its liberalization. But in the international monetary system we’re saddled with, it’s the latter that counts.And the effort that Chinese regulators have recently made to open up China’s securities markets won’t do much to change things.",439
215,"Even if the inclusion of Chinese bonds in the three main global indices – belonging to Bloomberg-Barclays, JP Morgan and FTSE Russell – brings in a few hundred billion dollars-worth of portfolio inflows over the next couple of years, this doesn’t have any real bearing on the renminbi’s future as a global reserve currency. After all, foreigners own some 40 percent of the Indonesian government’s rupiah-denominated debt, and no one would claim that the rupiah is on course for any global significance.The good news, in the end, is that there is no law of nature that requires a reserve currency to be a fully convertible one; it simply depends on convention, or the norms that happen to prevail at a particular time. The Bretton Woods international monetary system that was set up at the end of the Second World War, for example, had capital controls at its very center. The U.K. had capital controls until 1979, and it wasn’t until 1989 that France finally lifted the restrictions on its citizens’ ability to open bank accounts abroad.Incidentally, it was a remnant of the Bretton Woods system that helped to build the case for the renminbi’s inclusion into the IMF’s SDR basket a few years ago. The IMF’s carefully-phrased criterion for a currency to become part of the SDR basket was that it should be ‘freely usable’, which is certainly not the same thing as fully convertible. We know that’s true because the IMF first adopted the term ‘freely usable’ back in 1978 when plenty of big countries still had Bretton Woods-era controls in place.What all this means is that it might be possible one day for China to have its cake and eat it – in other words, for the renminbi to be a truly global currency and yet for China to retain a discretionary approach to managing the capital account – but it will probably take a Bretton Woods-like renegotiation of the international monetary system to get there. Don’t hold your breath.In any case, history strongly advises patience when it comes to the emergence of new super-currencies. The United States overtook Great Britain as the world’s largest economy sometime around the mid-1850s. And though the dollar did start to become a grown-up global funding currency after the First World War, it is worth remembering that even as late as 1947 sterling accounted for 87% of global foreign exchange reserves.",499

Women in the Economy- Citi Global Perspectives & SolutionsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountInclusive Economic Growth SeriesArticle14 Nov 2017Women in the Economy IIHow Implementing a Women’s Economic Empowerment Agenda Can Shape the Global EconomyCiti Global Perspectives & Solutions·ContributorsShareDownload   In 2015 we published the Citi GPS report Women in the Economy: Global Growth Generators, which made the case that the role of women in the labor force should be incorporated as a mainstream topic within the debate on global growth for both economic as well as social reasons. In our new report, we dig deeper into the economic case for female economic empowerment through some fresh insights on the key issues as well as through a series of country case studies comparing the U.S. with Canada and Italy with Sweden. Alongside this, we have produced a standalone investigation of the issues facing Japan where harnessing the potential of women in the economy will be vital to protecting even modest growth prospects in the country.We remain wary of the more exaggerated growth estimates driven by the simple assumption that direct female labor force participation and productivity can be raised fully to the current level of males. Instead, we estimate that significant, and in our view achievable, reductions in workplace gender inequalities could perhaps add around 6% to GDP in the advanced economies over the course of one or two decades — a very significant number relative to the potential of other structural reforms or to the relatively depressed growth prospects in advanced economies more generally.The specific measures required to advance economic gender equality differ widely from country to country. However, common themes emerge around government initiatives such as tax, childcare support, and retirement structures as well as workplace flexibility and other employer-led initiatives. The country comparison between the U.S. and Canada is particularly instructive in this context. In Canada, for example, we show that tax reforms as well as federal and provincial government support for parenting initiatives appear to have made a positive different to female employment rates.In the report we also highlight some key elements of the research done by the UN High-Level Panel on Women's Economic Empowerment (UN HLP), which was established in 2016 and included Citi's Chief Global Political Analyst Tina Fordham as one of its 20 senior representatives.",469
217,"To accelerate progress against the constraints that undermine women's economic opportunity in all aspects of work, the UN HLP has made recommendations to address these constraints, which we outline in the report. The recommendations encompass seven drivers of change: tackling adverse norms and promoting positive role models; ensuring legal protection and reforming discriminatory laws; recognizing and redistributing unpaid work and care; building financial, digital, and property assets for women; changing business culture and practices; improving public sector practices in employment and procurement; and strengthening visibility and representation of women.Picking up on one of the themes in the UN HLP work, we include a chapter in the report that looks at the potential of expanding financial access to women by introducing some practical examples which Citi has pioneered through our Inclusive Finance and Community Development teams. We also have two interviews — one with Simona Scarpaleggia, CEO of IKEA Switzerland and one with President Luis Guillermo Solis of Costa Rica — that discuss both the challenges that management has in maximizing corporate female labor participation and what role the government and private sector can play in advancing the UN principles around women's economic empowerment.Finally, we note that the rise in global assets that are managed according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria has risen dramatically and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are increasingly being endorsed by institutional investors as a roadmap to help drive progress on ESG issues. Within the SDG's, women's economic empowerment and diversity are the focus of two of the 17 SDGs and we believe the rise in social impact investing will lead to increased interest in both agendas.Authors: Tina M Fordham,Ebrahim Rahbari,Robert Annibale,Katsuhiko Aiba,Giada Giani,Andrew Labelle,Kiichi Murashima,Dana M Peterson,Click here to view the report in full.EconomicGrowthUNWomenWomen in the Economy SeriesUP NEXTArticleWomen in the Economy IICiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSeriesWomen in the Economy SeriesCiti Global Perspectives & SolutionsSubscribe to Citi GPSKeep up to date with our latest insights.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",470

There is an impressive and growing body of literature on women and the economy most notably from global institutions such as the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World Bank. This year the G20 has also included women as a driver of growth as part of its overall progress agenda. Despite this, most of the work produced by leading economists on global growth and, in particular, on whether we face a future of secular stagnation, still concentrates on monetary and fiscal policy responses.This report in our Citi GPS series is a statement that we at Citi believe that the role of women in the global labor force should be incorporated as a mainstream topic within the debate on global growth for both economic as well as social reasons. We shall be building on this report by developing a deeper research work stream on gender economics. In this report, our global economics team has partnered with Heidi Crebo-Rediker to analyze the dynamics of global female labor force participation. We are delighted to work with Heidi who has enjoyed a distinguished career in both business and government, including as Chief Economist at the State Department under Hillary Clinton where she worked and lectured on the topic of female labor force participation. Average female labor force participation has flat-lined over the past 20 years. In this report, our economists revisit the “Global Growth Generators” thesis that we outlined when we launched our Citi GPS series in 2011 and argue that fresh policy responses, as well as learning from best practice, could improve female labor force participation with significant benefits that are not just economic but also social as well. Looked at purely through an economic lens, greater female labor force participation would drive productivity, reduce the economic drag of adverse demographics and substantially improve the skill mix of the global economy. Of course, our authors point out that much work currently done in the informal economy cannot be ignored and does not get adequately captured in conventional economic measurements. Moreover, there are many cultural and societal issues that lie behind the gender composition of the global labor force, especially in developing economies. These issues also need to be analyzed and understood.",497

223,"global insights commercial bank a world in flux the merits of a global bank. A world in flux: the merits of a global bankOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle22 May 2023A world in flux: the merits of a global bankCommercial BankContributor(s):  Bill Stanton, UK Head of Citi Commercial BankShare The near-term macroeconomic outlook might be uncertain, but for mid-sized companies there are enormous opportunities as a result of once-in-a-generation structural shifts. Working with a global bank can help firms to weather today’s storms and set course for a promising future, writes Bill Stanton, UK Head of Citi Commercial Bank.   Mid-sized businesses headquartered in the UK, or international firms with UK subsidiaries, face a paradox. Many economic indicators make grim reading – Citi expects global growth to slow to 2.2%; inflation remains above target at 6%-9%; and interest rates are at levels not seen for 15 years. All the talk is of a further slowdown, although Citi puts the probability of a synchronized global recession at just 30%. Meanwhile, FX volatility has increased as geopolitical tensions impact sentiment, while energy and labor costs are sharply higher. Yet at the same time as mid-sized companies contend with these headwinds, the outlook is exciting. Many firms envisage expansion, not contraction, in the medium- and long-term – a fact that has helped to drive the outperformance of mid-cap indices this year. The need to address structural shifts, such as the elevation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, creates challenges. But it also generates potential opportunities to cut costs, win new customers and differentiate your business. Likewise, the rapid digitization of every industry segment requires investment. But harnessing the power of data and technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation can deliver dramatic process efficiency improvements across the business, from treasury and finance to operations and marketing. Many businesses see digitization as laying the groundwork for new business models and accelerated global expansion. Even the global economic uncertainty that has defined recent years, which has prompted a reshaping of supply chains to reduce perceived risks, has a potential silver lining. While the stakes are high – trade accounts for 52% of global GDP – moving production may cut costs, while reduced political risk in substitute countries should bolster stability.",476
224,"Similarly, nearshoring may have potential reputational and ESG benefits and improve companies’ flexibility to adapt to future disruptions or respond faster to changing customer demands.   Smart tactics and strategic vision To thrive in this period of paradox, mid-sized organizations need to be both agile and responsive to market changes, while remaining focused on their operational ambitions. One way to tackle today’s environment is to separate the challenges and opportunities into tactical and strategic imperatives.Tactics Tactics is about addressing the need for cost cutting and resilience in a challenging financial environment. At present Citi’s economists see global growth running at a sustained below-trend pace, as central banks deploy tight policies to fight inflation, and many countries face recessionary conditions. Many companies find that they are unable to pass on higher supply chain costs in full to customers: as a result, margins are under pressure. To lessen the pressure, companies need to pare costs wherever possible, which will also provide a buffer should a recession materialize in the coming months.   Strategy Strategy is about taking advantage of the key structural shifts– such as ESG and digitization as well as socio-economic shifts. The opportunities that these present could drive organic growth as well as M&A and capital raising. While both dealmaking and capital markets have come under pressure in recent months, there is still capital available for investment and M&A activity, provided a company’s story is compelling. In the first quarter of 2023, despite the marsh macroeconomic backdrop, total deal value globally was just shy of $1 trillion.Focusing on day-to-day efficiency For mid-sized companies with global ambitions, working with domestic banks could limit their horizons. In today’s environment, the need to work with a global bank that meets your day-to-day requirements for efficiency and transparency has never been greater. The right capabilities and solutions – from FX and interest rate hedging to trade tools and cash management – can have a material impact on mid-sized companies’ resilience. For instance, as more companies are seeking longer and more flexible payment terms, some of our clients have benefited from structured accounts receivable portfolio financing, which can be an efficient working capital optimization tool to reduce Days Sales Outstanding, while allowing longer payment terms for their strategic customers. Another example is the use of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) in payment processing, a growing trend that we see among our corporate clients in EMEA, enabling real-time reporting and visibility, which in turn drives more efficient reconciliation.",493
225,"Banks that have global capabilities and a market-leading position – Citi offers the capability to make payments in over 140 different currencies, for example – are better placed to offer competitive FX rates than rivals with a domestic focus. International banks can also advise on and facilitate appropriate hedging strategies to minimize FX volatility, which has wrought havoc on some companies’ P&L over the past year. While some banks are focused only on G7 currencies, Citi’s capabilities mean it can help firms implement hedging strategies for a much wider spectrum of currency exposures. The recent market changes that have particularly affected emerging companies in the digital space, have highlighted the importance to fine tune the use of cash. By implementing pooling and netting structures, firms can optimize their cash, reducing the need to run costly overdrafts in some countries. Alternatively, cash generative companies may be able to benefit by concentrating surplus cash so that it earns the best possible yield.   Looking to the long term At a practical level, international banks have the infrastructure in place to help clients grow without needing to rely on multiple bank relationships. Efficient payment and collection processes is only part of the challenge, with access to capital and expertise being another. Digital disruptors and other companies going global require consistency, visibility and control wherever they operate, while gaining access to solutions and local market instruments that lower transaction costs.In an environment where counterparty risk is more prevalent, Citi has proven resilient, reliably providing access to a wide range of alternative sources of funding, including private and public equity markets, and private, high-yield bond or syndicated debt markets. Citi can ensure clients receive guidance on the merits of various choices, and appropriate timing for, capital raising. This could help achieve lower financing costs and a sustainable debt and equity profile that benefits your company’s long-term growth. Citi Commercial Bank combines market knowledge with industry sector expertise, and understands the competitive dynamics impacting its clients and how peer companies fund themselves or are evolving their M&A strategies, providing these valuable insights that can help gain a competitive advantage.",413

227,"global insights commercial bank analyze and adapt why your payments strategy should constantly evolve. Analyze and adapt: why your payments strategy should constantly evolveOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle10 May 2023Analyze and adapt: why your payments strategy should constantly evolveCommercial BankShareAs your company grows, you may need to reassess your approach to payments. A smart approach – such as utilizing standardized file formats or APIs depending on your needs – can transform bank connectivity, lower costs and support your operational objectives.   Payments are a key function for every business. But too often, decisions about payments are made in isolation rather than as part of a clearly defined strategy; efficiency is an afterthought.   A more deliberate approach to payments can cut costs, enhance visibility and control, and improve relationships with beneficiaries such as employees, suppliers or customers.   Each company’s needs and operational objectives differ; there’s no one-size fits all solution. Your goal should be to find the most efficient and cost-effective approach given your payment objectives and treasury resources.Analyzing your paymentsTo find out if you have the right payments strategy, you first need to understand who you are paying, and how. This can be harder than it sounds.   Your bank should be able to help. Citi’s Client Relationship Insights tool can analyse your payments file every quarter, helping you to avoid costly cross-border payments and replace cheques with ACH payments, for instance.   Your bank may also have relationships with some of your beneficiaries and know their payment preferences. If you can switch a supplier to virtual card payments, you not only improve efficiency but also enhance working capital and benefit from potential rebates.   The right analytics can even identify dormant accounts – set up for a one-off tax payment, for example – so that they can be closed, eliminating any associated fees.Follow the payments path… or leapfrog to APIs Many companies follow the payments path outlined below, which delivers incremental benefits at every stage. But you can skip levels – or go straight to stage 5 – depending on your needs.   1. Online banking portal A banking portal makes sense for a small company making a few payments each day. Payments are easy to manage, with beneficiary details stored for reuse.   2. Pre-formatted templates Pre-formatted templates are perfect for companies with higher payment volumes because they eliminate some manual processes. Treasury staff can use existing information and simply change the value date or amount for new payments.",501
228,"  By cutting out some stages in the payments process, preformatted templates are especially helpful for companies that work with more than one bank and therefore have to log on and input transactions on multiple portals. Preformatted templates can also make it easier to reconcile payments using information from an ERP system and can help reduce processing/fraud risks.   3. Bulk payments using file formats such as CSV Companies making higher volumes of payments or looking to eliminate more manual processes (and further enhance efficiency) can upload a bulk payments file straight from their TMS or ERP system to a bank via host-to-host connectivity.   4. XML ISO 20022 File formats vary by country and even between banks so while making bulk payments using CSV or other files types streamlines treasury processes, it doesn't eliminate fully manual intervention. XML ISO 20022 is a standardized file format developed to enable easy electronic data exchange between financial institutions. For companies seeking next-level efficiency, it overcomes many of the challenges associated with varying file formats. To get the full benefit of XML ISO 20022, your lead bank will need to arrange a harmonization meeting to ensure easy communication as banks have interpreted the standard in different ways.   5. Application programming interfaces (APIs) Once payments reach a significant volume – which can happen almost immediately for some new companies – it makes sense to streamline bank connectivity. APIs are small packets of code that connect two different systems seamlessly; they are at the heart of the apps we use on our phones.   When it comes to payments, they effectively put your bank’s capabilities inside your TMS or ERP system. That frees up treasury time – a single click can action a payment – and improves efficiency.   APIs facilitate 24/7 instant payments to customers, so they are perfect for sectors such as the gig economy where suppliers and workers expect to be paid immediately. APIs don’t require you to adapt your systems so implementation is faster. You still need to agree on standards with your banks but this can be done in a sandbox environment; you configure the API for your system based on a bank’s repository of functionality.   Given their benefits, a growing number of companies are using APIs for payments requests; the number of Citi’s institutional clients using them grew by 30% from Q1 2022 to Q1 2023 while the volume of payment requests initiated via APIs rose by 36%.",483

Optimizing atai Life Sciences’ Banking Structure to Drive GrowthOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle13 Sep 2022Optimizing atai Life Sciences’ Banking Structure to Drive GrowthCommercial BankContributor(s):  Richard Rambo (Vice President, Life Sciences Group, US Citi Commercial Bank)ShareDOWNLOADFounded in 2018, atai is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that uses a decentralized business model to accelerate the development of mental health treatments.The Challenge Traditionally, biotech companies focus on a limited number of technologies. In contrast, atai operates a decentralized platform approach to enable scalable drug or technological development at its atai companies (commonly known as a hub and spoke model). By leveraging its funding, technology, scientific, operational and regulatory expertise, atai helps accelerate treatments for targeted patient groups across a broad portfolio of companies globally, each dedicated to different drug programs.   As atai grew and moved towards an IPO, it needed to establish a banking relationship with a partner that could accommodate its global footprint and complex structure. Specifically, atai wanted to rationalize the fragmented banking relationships of 20 legal entities and concentrate activity with a single global bank. The company had relationships with several banks in the US and multiple local banks around the world, which increased costs and unnecessarily put a burden on resources.   Given a demanding timeline for the IPO, there was a need to rapidly open accounts and onboard atai’s entities in several key markets around the globe.   The Solution Citi Commercial Bank was one of the few banks able to meet atai’s needs in the US and Western Europe, and provide a network to support future expansion as the company grows its presence in additional regions, most recently in the Asia Pacific. Ahead of atai’s IPO, Citi Commercial Bank onboarded 20 legal entities, both domestically and internationally. Citi’s subsidiaries coverage team in each geography facilitated onboarding, taking into account local regulations and standards. All accounts are visible to atai via the CitiDirect® online banking platform.     The Result atai implemented a streamlined banking structure in advance of its IPO, improving its cash and liquidity management and treasury oversight by centralizing banking activities. In doing so, the company created opportunities to enhance working capital efficiency, improve liquidity management, and simplify payments and collections.",490

Automating FX hedging for healthcare companies — don’t go at it aloneOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle27 Jun 2023Automating FX hedging for healthcare companies — don’t go at it aloneCommercial BankShareDOWNLOADPORTUGUESE As the world pushes past the pandemic, healthcare companies are working to firm up their long term growth strategies. Though management often seek growth through acquisitions, sometimes the opposite is needed to reinvigorate the company and unlock long-term value. Among the largest healthcare players, there has already been a number of high-profile announcements where larger companies are splitting and creating separate healthcare units. Others are spinning off specific units and assets to allow greater focus and flexibility to pursue divergent growth paths.   Planning for change Post separation, the independent entity likely have to set up its policies, processes, and systems. For treasuries, planning for the separation starts before day-one as teams from both side  review capabilities and coordinate handoff. Sometimes, to ease transition, a Transition Service Agreement is agreed to for the parent to continue to perform certain treasury functions for the new company. The best way forward, however, is in-house so treasury can have control and visibility over its data. This involves setting up company specific plans that tie back to the organization’s strategic vision (do you want global visibility? real-time data? and automation?)   Don’t go at it alone Building up a new treasury may involve leaner organizations and potentially fewer resources than what is available at a larger, legacy company. Often, technology must pave the way. One avenue for the new independent company is to leverage platforms that banking partners offer and explore technological solutions that may suit its workflows and strategic plans. An example of such partnership is in the workflow related to FX risk management and dealing.   FX is a key area for the new treasury if company has a global footprint. Movements in the exchange rates – some can be upwards of 10-15% YOY change – can have material impact on operational results and financial metrics, thus affecting investors’ assessment of the company.     Transition toward operational excellence For the new company, efficiency and operational excellence can be achieved with technology. Companies can decide on the degree of integration and connectivity that fits with their overall goals.",486
231,"Post-trade straight-through-processing (STP), for example, while not new, is a versatile starting point. Many banking partners can offer proprietary STP solutions that aggregate executed FX trades and automate delivery of transaction details to a company’s treasury management system (TMS). The ability to automate post-trade processes can produce many benefits by reducing error rates and speeding up processing and reconciliation. However, STP does not have to apply only to post-trade. Citi’s CitiFX Pulse can help companies create greater efficiency in pre-trade workflow with connectivity and auto execution of hedging trades.   In the pre-trade, CitiFX Pulse can be connected to a company’s TMS to receive data related to FX exposures. The transmit frequency can be set to a desired interval: if payables and receivables are booked daily, data can be sent daily to capture new positions. The transmitted data can be converted and reconciled to a Citi format (with embedded ETL technology), creating FX exposures within the Exposure Management module. Critically, the module will allow companies the ability to implement their hedge policy and be in control of defining the auto-execution rule. Incoming exposures are hedged according to the pre-specified rules and executed trades are subsequently fed back to the TMS to calculate net position for next day.   Benefits of automating the hedging process In CitiFX Pulse’s automated FX risk management solution, a company can run an efficient risk management process by leveraging technology to run end-to-end processes. Doing so would allow the new treasury to reduce time and resources expended on non strategic activities (reconciling formats, inputting trades, manually calculating net exposures to hedge). Moreover, when exposures and trade data are connected, risk monitoring can be better supported and updated on a timely basis. With volatile currency market conditions expected to continue, accurate FX data will be critical to allow companies better insight and make more informed decisions.   For more information about how Citi Commercial Bank can assist you and your team, please contact us below     PortugueseAutomatizando o hedge cambial em empresas de saúde — melhor não fazer isso sozinho À medida que o mundo supera a pandemia, empresas de saúde trabalham para firmar estratégias de crescimento de longo prazo.",459
232,"Embora muitas vezes os administradores busquem crescimento por meio de aquisições, às vezes o oposto é necessário para revigorar a empresa e gerar valor de longo prazo. Entre os maiores players, já houve vários anúncios de alto nível em que empresas maiores estão se dividindo e criando unidades de saúde separadas. Outras estão separando unidades e ativos específicos para permitir maior foco e flexibilidade para buscar caminhos de crescimento divergentes. Planejando a mudança Após a separação, a entidade independente provavelmente terá que definir suas políticas, processos e sistemas. Para tesourarias, o planejamento da separação começa antes do primeiro dia, à medida que as equipes de ambos os lados revisam os recursos e coordenam a transferência. Às vezes, para facilitar a transição, um Acordo de Serviço de Transição é feito para que a controladora continue desempenhando determinadas funções de tesouraria para a nova empresa. O melhor caminho a seguir, no entanto, é interno, para que a tesouraria possa ter controle e visibilidade sobre seus dados. Isso envolve a criação de planos específicos da empresa que se relacionam com a visão estratégica da organização (você quer visibilidade global? dados em tempo real? e automação?) Não faça isso sozinho Construir uma nova tesouraria pode envolver organizações mais enxutas e potencialmente menos recursos do que os disponíveis em uma empresa legada maior. Muitas vezes, a tecnologia deve abrir o caminho. Um caminho para a nova empresa independente é alavancar as plataformas que os parceiros bancários oferecem e explorar soluções tecnológicas que possam se adequar aos seus fluxos de trabalho e planos estratégicos. Um exemplo desse tipo de parceria está no fluxo de trabalho relacionado à gestão e negociação de riscos cambiais. FX é uma área chave para a nova tesouraria se a empresa tiver presença global.",474
233,"Oscilações no câmbio – às vezes superior a 10-15% de variação anual – podem ter um impacto material nos resultados operacionais e nas métricas financeiras, afetando assim a avaliação dos investidores sobre a empresa. Transição para a excelência operacional Para a nova empresa, eficiência e excelência operacional podem ser alcançadas com tecnologia. As empresas podem decidir sobre o grau de integração e conectividade que se adequa aos seus objetivos gerais. O processamento direto pós-negociação (STP), por exemplo, embora não seja novo, é um ponto de partida versátil. Muitos parceiros bancários podem oferecer soluções STP proprietárias que agregam transações FX executadas e automatizam a entrega de detalhes de transações para o sistema de gerenciamento de tesouraria (TMS) de uma empresa. A capacidade de automatizar os processos de pós negociação pode produzir muitos benefícios, reduzindo as taxas de erro e acelerando o processamento e a reconciliação. No entanto, o STP não precisa se aplicar apenas ao pós-negociação. O CitiFX Pulse do Citi pode ajudar as empresas a criar maior eficiência no fluxo de trabalho pré-negociação com conectividade e execução automática de negociações de hedge. Na pré-negociação, o CitiFX Pulse pode ser conectado ao TMS de uma empresa para receber dados relacionados às exposições cambiais. A frequência de transmissão pode ser ajustada para um intervalo desejado: se as contas a pagar e a receber forem registradas diariamente, os dados podem ser enviados diariamente para capturar novas posições. Os dados transmitidos podem ser convertidos e reconciliados para um formato Citi (com tecnologia ETL incorporada), criando exposições FX dentro do módulo Exposure Management.

Bringing embedded banking to life for mid-market companiesOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle01 Aug 2023Bringing embedded banking to life for mid-market companiesCommercial BankShareDOWNLOAD Digitization is a key theme for most mid-size companies as they look for ways to improve efficiency and accelerate their ability to respond to change. But many face a fundamental challenge when it comes to checking their bank account balances and matching them against invoices they have issued and payments they have made. The good news is that an innovative product is now available to help address these challenges. The age-old challenge for mid-sized companies Most firms work with multiple banks and must manually log into each bank’s portal regularly to view account balances, payments and collections. When companies need to use that bank information to reconcile invoices, which sit on their accounting platform, they have to manually copy and paste it, and upload it to Excel – some companies even print and re-key the information. This not only takes time, but increases the risk of manual error.   The payment process is no less cumbersome. While a list of regular beneficiaries might be stored on the banking portal, suppliers’ details are on a company’s accounting platform. Companies must log in to their banking website, find the right supplier and manually enter payment information such as the amount or reference.   Larger corporates tend to use ERP systems that can easily integrate with their banks to automate many of these processes. But for mid-size companies using standard accounting software, such integration has been a pipe dream.   Quick Integration — via a simple download Citi, working with a leading fintech partner, has developed a software package called Citi Integrator that can bring together mid-sized companies’ accounting platforms and their bank information. This integration tool currently works with QuickBooks® accounting software. Typically, IT integration projects take several weeks and require full IT support. With Citi Integrator, users simply download the software via a link, run the package and set it up. There is no need to share sensitive financial data or login credentials with third-party applications.   Moreover, certificate updates — which usually occur every six months and require secure tokens to be procured from a third party — are automatically updated for Citi Integrator, so there are no ongoing maintenance requirements.",474
236,"  Flexible reconciliation options Citi Integrator gives users full access to their relevant banking information, including account balances for checking and saving/IMMA accounts, prior day and intraday balances, and transaction details (including debits, credits and dates).   Perhaps the most important feature in Citi Integrator is ‘update to accounting platform’, which removes the need for companies to check whether invoices have been paid and then update their ledger.   With Citi Integrator, clients generate an invoice in their accounting platform and issue it as usual. Citi Integrator automatically pulls in these invoices. When they are paid, the client can choose one of the two following options (on either a prior day or intraday basis): Automatic reconciliation (‘set and forget’) takes place at a time of the client’s choosing, and for their specified bank accounts. Manual reconciliation enables the client to select a specific transaction within their accounting platform and click to reconcile it. For payment initiation, Citi Integrator offers internal transfer between Citi accounts, domestic and foreign wire payments, as well as an invoice payment option. Again, all options are fully integrated with a client’s accounting platform and are automatically reconciled in line with the client’s choice of reconciliation option.   A game-changer for mid-sized firms For too long, mid-sized companies have missed out on the efficiency and convenience benefits of integrating their accounting platform and bank information. With the costs of deploying an ERP system beyond all but the largest firms, most have continued to manually reconcile payments and collections. Citi Integrator is currently available in North America for Citi Commercial Bank clients.

Case Study: Multi-Currency Payment Solution for Healthcare CompanyOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle19 Jan 2022Case Study: Multi-Currency Payment Solution for Healthcare CompanyCommercial BankShareDownloadCelltrion Healthcare is a fast-growing biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Incheon, South Korea. It conducts worldwide marketing, sales and distribution of biological medicines, including the breakthrough antibody biosimilar Remsima, which provides treatment for autoimmune diseases. The company has grown considerably over the last several years, and now has subsidiaries in 30 countries and sales in over 110 countries. Its supply chain model has also grown accordingly, with Korea sourcing active drug ingredients, Germany handling the packaging, the U.S. managing production and quality inspection, and Hungary operating as the logistic and treasury hub.The Challenge As Celltrion continued to grow and expand across Europe, the regional treasury hub in Hungary became the primary purchasing entity. This Hungarian center would sell the purchased products to Celltrion subsidiaries around the world, receiving payment from the subsidiaries in each of their local currencies. Celltrion Healthcare did not wish to open accounts in all the currencies of the subsidiaries, as it knew that this would be complicated and costly from an efficiency perspective. Instead, it sought an automated solution which would provide FX centralization, full control, and instant visibility so that it could mitigate currency risks and more effectively manage cash. The currencies initially in scope were Danish Krone, Swedish Krona, Norwegian Krone, Swiss Franc, Pound Sterling and Romania Leu.   The Solution Citi has been providing Celltrion with global cash management since 2018, and we have formed a strong relationship with the company that allowed us to understand the challenges and suggest an integrated FX solution that could simplify operations. Citi proposed a process for Celltrion Hungary whereby FX spreads could be pre-agreed and locked in when the subsidiaries were sending local currency payments. The Hungarian entity would receive the payments in a single currency, at the expected exchange rates, without having to open multiple accounts. The speed of implementation was also important for Celltrion. Citi was able to set up the solution in under 24 hours, and the day after implementation the company was up and running, immediately benefiting from the solution.",474

The geopolitical tensions between the US and China, for example, have impacted supply chains across the world, while the ongoing effects of Brexit have seen red tape tie up UK businesses and their trading partners.  Add in the aftershocks of Covid-19, ever-changing data privacy regulations, evolving trade agreements such as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA) replacing NAFTA, and the fact that the World Trade Organization noted that these barriers affect SMEs more than large organizations, and you have something approaching a perfect storm.  Deep local knowledge is key to expansion success It’s a view shared by the United States International Trade Commission, which points out that SMEs may lack the resources and local knowledge needed to navigate these increased complexities. But while these challenges are significant, they’re not insurmountable – provided companies employ some expertise to help them on their expansion journey. Volex, a global leader in integrated manufacturing for performance-critical applications and a supplier of power products, is a case in point. A new management team in 2015 prompted a change in strategy with the company expanding quickly to become a more profitable and acquisitive operation, buying related businesses around the world and growing its product offering.  Today, Volex is a more diverse and resilient business with a global footprint spanning 28 sites on three continents with over 11,500 employees across 24 countries serving the complex industrial technology, consumer electricals, electric vehicles, medical and off-highway markets. “We’ve doubled in size over the past five years and our plans are to double in size again,” says Volex Group CFO Jon Boaden.",494
240,"A $400mn investment in acquisitions since 2018 necessitated moving into markets where they previously had no presence. “We have vastly expanded our manufacturing, too,” Boaden says. “We’ve advanced manufacturing capabilities in Mexico, the US, China, Indonesia, Turkey, Vietnam, India and more.” Company acquisitions can bring banking challenges However, Boaden points out that this expansion comes with its own headaches. For example, acquiring owner-managed businesses means they may be relatively unsophisticated when it comes to foreign currency exposure. And moving into new territories means tackling different regulatory requirements, which can be particularly stringent in Volex’s sector. The firm’s partnership with Citi Commercial Bank has proved invaluable in addressing many of the expansion challenges. “Citi has proved really proactive and insightful when it comes to banking strategies,” he says. “We can leverage Citi’s platform across every country we operate in. We haven’t yet found a country where Citi can’t support us in dealing with the intricacies of overseas business.” This consistency in banking operations, with the same processes and controls being used worldwide, also reduces risk to Volex’s margins from currency conversion. Huaijin Bao, Global Head of Industrials at Citi Commercial Bank, is keen to point out that while Citi’s initial role was to help with financing acquisitions, working capital and ensuring a smooth-running banking process in new territories, this has opened up as the relationship has deepened. “We enjoy a wide-ranging advisory role with Volex,” says Huaijin. “Not just on banking matters such as local regulations or global cash management, but also with industry insights. Our Industrials team comprises eight or nine subsectors, many of which are downstream industries that Volex is involved in, such as EV, consumer electronics, industrial technology and med-tech. This multi-sector expertise means we can advise our clients not just on their industry, but also share insights with them around adjacent and interconnected sectors. This means we can provide clients with a much broader view of trends and developments across relevant verticals.” Boaden agrees, pointing out that Citi has provided him with a “tremendous amount of intelligence and a wealth of research” that has helped inform Volex’s growth strategy. “With Citi’s help, we’ve identified the right markets, the right customers and the right ways of working. The business is operating incredibly well at the moment.",498

Companies look to shift supply chain to Southeast AsiaOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Industrials CompaniesArticle01 Jun 2019Companies look to shift supply chain to Southeast AsiaCommercial BankShareDOWNLOADIn his role as Head of the Commercial Subsidiaries Group in Singapore, Citi Commercial Bank Senior Vice President Dann Sim works with companies establishing a presence in Singapore, either to access the domestic market or serve as an ASEAN hub. Here he explains the evolution of clients’ supply chains.Q: How are clients’ supply chains changing – and why? A: We have multiple touch points and interactions with clients and get consistent feedback that companies are increasingly pivoting some of their business operation activities to Southeast Asia. The immediate driver for this is, of course, the US-China trade war. China has always been the ’world’s factory’ but increased tariffs put its goods in a disadvantageous position. That’s prompting China-based firms to reassess their supply chain strategy and search for new markets. This also applies to local companies in China, many of which have become sophisticated and sizable. While their core manufacturing capabilities remain in their home country, they recognize that by being in only one country they lack the flexibility to adapt to geopolitical risks. So now they’re exploring secondary manufacturing locations such as in Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia to diversify their risk and exposure. Q: What are the longer-term factors prompting the growth of manufacturing in Southeast Asia? A: In the past, when US, European and Japanese companies reached a certain scale and became global, they sought ways to diversify risk; the same is now happening for Asian companies. They don’t want to have all their manufacturing capability concentrated in one country because it is not a prudent way to manage a business. For companies from any location, there has always been this need to diversify a company’s manufacturing base at some stage. In the case of China, there are other factors at work. The cost of manufacturing – labor and production costs – has risen steadily over the past decade. As China moves up the value chain, many industries may find it may no longer be the cheapest or most cost-effective place to manufacture. The same product may now be produced at a lower cost in places like Vietnam and Indonesia. And Cambodia and Laos are on the horizon as alternative locations with even lower costs.",493
242,"Q: How extensive is this supply chain shift among midsized and emerging corporations? A: Last year, Citi Commercial Bank held a series of ASEANthemed seminars in Asia to educate clients about the region and highlight the characteristics and strengths of each member country for businesses. The clients who attended were very engaged and we have seen a heightened level of interest in attending these sessions; a growing number of clients are planning to expand into select ASEAN countries. Their country of choice depends on the industry, which range from electronic device and component manufacturers to garment and textile companies to manufacturers of renewable energy-related components such as solar modules. Interestingly, Taiwan has developed the New Southbound policy, which is encouraging Taiwanese companies to establish a presence in Southeast Asia. In the past, Taiwanese expansion to Southeast Asia was on a limited scale. We expect that to change going forward. With the emergence of Vietnam as a viable manufacturing base and Indonesia increasingly opening up, ASEAN has the infrastructure to encourage Taiwanese, as well as Chinese and Korean companies, to shift parts of their production bases to Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. Q: Are companies also shifting treasury and financing operations? A: Yes. In Singapore we see the indirect effect of these supply chain shifts. Once companies move to places like Vietnam, Indonesia or Thailand, they often need a regional treasury in this part of the world. Singapore and Hong Kong are the most common choices. Often, these hubs take on the role of regional treasury and invoicing centers, providing funding and regional cash management services. Q: What should clients consider if they are moving out of China? A: To be clear, our customers are not abandoning manufacturing in China; it will continue to be a very significant part of their overall manufacturing capability. The change underway is really about having an alternative or secondary option to China. It is unlikely companies will move all of their operations out of China and go to another country. There is still no other country, right now at least, that can replace China as an optimal location for large scale manufacturing because of its population base and demographics. Down the road, maybe Indonesia or India could step in to partially, if not significantly, replace China’s ability to produce. But in the foreseeable future, I don’t see this happening. What I think we will see is companies, even Chinese companies, actively looking outside China to find alternatives sources for pieces of their supply chain to diversify concentration risk and minimize disruption to their business.",494

246,"global insights commercial bank dont forget the power of politics. When Assessing Exposure, Don’t Forget the Power of PoliticsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Business & Professional Services CompaniesArticle07 Mar 2022When Assessing Exposure, Don’t Forget the Power of PoliticsCommercial BankShareDownloadPortuguêsWhen companies do business in international markets, it is essential that they understand the potential impact that geopolitical events can have on their exposures and activities. Economic performance and policy variables are often given priority, as they can heavily influence currency movements. We saw this in 2021, when the COVID-induced surge in inflation necessitated responses from central banks, which in turn had predictable impacts on currency markets. But companies should also be careful not to forget the sway of geopolitics, especially as 2022 opens with uncertainty over Russia and several consequential elections throughout the year. Companies that account for these political factors can plan for the best strategies and solutions to protect themselves. In forecasting exchange rates or understanding the macro backdrop that drives financial markets, the presumption is that key factors will reflect a combination of economic performance and policy variables. For much of 2021, the focus has been on the global surge in inflation and the central bank response – albeit more in the emerging markets than the main industrial countries. But this was starting to change toward year-end when the Fed started to ‘taper’ – that is, reduce the scale of its asset purchases – and market sentiment swung in a very short period from expecting no interest rate increases until the end of 2022 to at least four 25 bps hikes during the year, with more to come in 2023. The Bank of England has already started its tightening cycle. The European Central Bank, however, still exhibits a reticence toward tightening. The reliance on economic measures allows for relatively smooth adjustments in forecasts but it falls short in one important dimension: it fails to account for the discontinuities resulting from political changes. Recent events and the electoral calendar remind us of the importance of global events – the crisis resulting from Russia’s new-found security “demands”, the continuing tensions between China and Taiwan, and the ever-present threat from North Korea as examples – as well as domestic politics, for which the electoral calendar looms large in Australia, South Korea, France, and Brazil, to name just a few.",480
247,"  Geopolitics Although a more extreme example, the Russia/Ukraine situation shows just how important it is to account for geopolitical uncertainties in addition to the usual economic and market-related factors when reviewing a currency’s outlook. Prior to the recent escalation, the high level of oil prices and the aggressive tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of Russia would have led to the presumption of an appreciating Russian ruble. But as illustrated in Figure 1, the ruble had actually been depreciating since late October 2021, well before the February 2022 military escalation. Western sanctions against Russia in response to the conflict have obviously led to a sharp depreciation of the ruble, but even the threat of political instability alone last year was enough to overpower the traditional factors, before any sanctions actually came into place. The key question then becomes: how should companies manage the uncertainties in advance? Much of the foreign exchange discussions between banks and their corporate clients center on risk management and hedging activities. But when geopolitics enters the equation, this may not be adequate. The threat of sanctions always raises the possibility that companies may not be able to gain access to their funds held in affected countries, so the number one question should potentially be: “can you get the money out?”, with a priority on how to answer that question in practice, rather than thinking about a hedging decision.   Electoral Politics Elections can generate enough noise to overrule economic factors as well. Last year witnessed large depreciations of the Peruvian sol and Chilean peso ahead of presidential elections, which were won by left-wing candidates. The economic scenario of higher copper prices provided little benefit to either currency despite the fact Peru and Chile are top producers of the metal. More recently, at least part of the weakness of the Korean won has been associated with concerns about the upcoming presidential election. The same is true with the Colombian peso. The question in all these cases is to what extent will the winning candidates seek to implement radically different policies from their predecessors or to what extent will they be forced to move to the political center in order to gain parliamentary support. The three elections set to garner the most market attention are the presidential elections in France and Brazil, and the U.S. mid-term elections, which may present some risk for the U.S. dollar. With Democratic Senate wins in Georgia in January 2021, it became possible for the Biden Administration to adopt its initial stimulus measures, which in turn fed through to a more robust U.S.",501
248,"dollar. But should Republicans regain control of either, or both, houses of Congress, the risk is that the following two years could be characterized by policy stalemate, with negative implications for the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar.   Brazil: In Focus The presidential election in Brazil could see a contest between the incumbent right-of-center President Bolsonaro and the left-of-center former President Lula. When Lula first won election in 2002 (he took office in 2003), he largely maintained the centrist economic policies of his predecessor amidst a period of economic crisis. But what are the policy risks if the choice appears to be between two extremes? Does the market sell the Brazilian real ahead of the elections “just in case”? This kind of uncertainty is the reason why election time is often associated with higher volatility for a country’s currency. For USDBRL, the previous elections showed exactly that. Figure 3 shows three-month historical volatility of USDBRL from 400-days before voters cast a vote to 50 days after. Historical volatility is a statistical measure representing the standard deviation of spot changes over a period, in this case three months. The 2018 election occurred during a tumultuous time in Brazilian politics, and spot volatility started to rise well ahead of election day until it more than doubled. In 2014, USDBRL spot changes dampened until closer to election day but spiked sharply after. In 2010, volatility rose to a peak before reversing course. As history showed, it is difficult to predict the path of spot movements and market responses to news, polls and such.  Prudent treasurers would be wise to look at potential scenarios, manage interim market volatility, and minimize market noise from financial results.   In conclusion 2022 is shaping up to be a big year for elections and geopolitics. Corporate treasurers who understand the impact of these factors on currency movements, and by extension their exposures, in addition to traditional economic and policy factors, can plan for the best strategies and solutions to protect themselves.",419

ESG: Moving industry towards a cleaner, safer worldOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Business & Professional Services CompaniesArticle11 Dec 2023ESG: Moving industry towards a cleaner, safer worldCommercial BankShareDiscover how one company is helping businesses across various sectors become more sustainable.*This partner content was produced by the Financial Times on behalf of Citi Commercial Bank There is no such thing in life as a sure bet. The same holds true in business, with companies that would seem destined for success often falling by the wayside – from retail groups misunderstanding cultural differences when they move into new regions to tech firms making the wrong call on product innovations. As the author Malcolm Gladwell says in Outliers, “Success is not a random act. It arises out of a predictable and powerful set of opportunities and circumstances.” Concerned by climate change, investors are showing growing interest in sustainability-based investment opportunities. Many of the businesses helping to support the green economy prove that working towards what’s been dubbed the “triple bottom line” of profit, people and the planet doesn’t mean that you have to sacrifice profit in the pursuit of social and environmental goals. And as environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns and requirements grow in importance due to increased public attention and scrutiny, there are significant opportunities for companies positioned to address them. Meeting industry’s environmental challenges One company that is helping organizations realize their environmental ambitions and, crucially, comply with increasingly stringent regulations, is CECO Environmental Corp. CECO is involved in the engineering, designing, fabricating and installing of systems and solutions that capture, clean and destroy airborne and waterborne contaminants from industrial facilities, as well as fluid handling, gas separation, emissions management and treatment and liquid filtration systems. In other words, they help to clean up the mess that industry creates. There’s a famous saying, said to originate from Yorkshire, England, that asserts: “Where there’s muck, there’s brass.” Translation: there’s money to be made in tackling dirty or unpleasant jobs. And the continuing global expansion of CECO bears this out, because while many businesses may see ESG requirements as a challenge, they represent an opportunity for CECO. “We provide solutions to customers to address those needs,” says Peter Johansson, SVP, Chief Strategy and Financial Officer, CECO Environmental.",501
253,"“Let’s face it, very few companies want to invest in pollution controls. Most companies realize the importance of doing so, but want to minimize the cost. So the challenge can be helping them to understand that there's true economic benefit to being a good steward of the environment and putting in the most sophisticated, highest-performing pollution or contamination controls that you can, because there are not only savings in the short run, but there's a long-term benefit to brand, a long-term benefit to your reputation as a company and also a long-term benefit to your relationship with your regulators.” As a medium-sized company, CECO has seen strong global growth in recent years, driven in part by tighter environmental regulations placed on its customers, as well as closer scrutiny from other stakeholders of those customers’ businesses – but also by changing market trends in industrial operations. For example, Johansson points to the fact that many of CECO’s customers are now reinvesting in the manufacturing base of their respective countries whereas they previously saw globalization as an opportunity to outsource work to lower cost regions. Return to the source “You might call it reindustrialization or reshoring,” he explains. “We see it with one of our customers, which needs to process more metals in the US, rather than in countries that sit further from their main operations. Or another client that’s returning electronics production – such as semiconductors – to its US base. Consequently, we’re supporting the build-out of new capacity for customer operations that previously had no US manufacturing base, or had exited it. Shortening supply chains is also linked to this, which often requires investment in exhausted or ageing infrastructure. There are plenty of opportunities emerging where CECO can help with environmental solutions.” And, as more and more of CECO’s customers require new environmental solutions globally, its business continues to grow, too. This continued international expansion prompted the company to prioritise working with a banking partner that shared its vision. Citi Commercial Bank became one of CECO’s lenders, helping to underwrite the brand’s revolver and term loan facility, and funding the firm’s development by providing growth capital. “Every time we work with Citi, it’s a positive experience,” says Johansson.",456
254,"“They have such a great footprint that they can support our global expansion and help us to pursue larger and larger projects.” John Burke, Managing Director, Global Head of Business & Professional Services, Citi Commercial Bank, agrees that it’s Citi’s “boots on the ground” capabilities that help customers such as CECO overcome expansion challenges. “We have network banking teams around the world,” he says. “As your business expands into new countries, we have local colleagues that can support you, managing flows, risk, currency fluctuations, local practices, market nuances and more.” Burke adds that Citi also supports CECO by advising on creative ways to grow its business, and points out that the two firms are a “great fit” for each other, as Citi has been engaging on sustainability and environmental initiatives for more than 20 years and is committed to net zero by 2050. “Citi is keen to work with and support mid-sized companies who play a key role in solving the world’s most pressing challenges and to assist them in capturing opportunities as they manage the transition to a more sustainable future,” says Burke. “We’re proud to work with CECO,” he adds. “We are excited to see them continue on their growth trajectory and we want to be their global bank of choice to help build a seamless, successful expansion.” Three years ago, CECO’s annual revenue was approximately $310mn; in 2023 it is on track to exceed $525mn and, according to Johansson, they now believe they are “on a firm path to create sustained top-line and bottom-line growth targeting $600mn plus of revenue by 2025 with mid-teen EBITDA margins.” “High-growth firms need access to high-quality finance,” he adds.",363
255,"global insights commercial bank expanding rapidly don t grow alone. Expanding Rapidly? Don’t Grow AloneOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle09 Nov 2021Expanding Rapidly? Don’t Grow AloneCommercial BankShareDOWNLOADFrom online gaming and shopping to education and software services, the digital, technology and communications industries saw continued and even accelerated growth during the global pandemic while many other industries suffered from supply chain issues.With online distribution models and few physical assets, companies with digital offerings are built for growth — and rapid expansion often calls for speedy decision making. But hasty banking choices made early on can lead to major headaches down the road. A strong banking partner can help avoid those issues.   Senior executives at these “digital” companies are understandably focused on business expansion, and they may not have the time or resources to devote to less glamorous banking decisions. Others may understand the importance of making strategic decisions on payments, collections, and other transaction services, but quickly grow frustrated if their bank cannot move fast enough. The right banking partner solves both problems — allowing management to stay focused on business growth while positioning the company to scale up efficiently and quickly.   To illustrate some of the pitfalls encountered by fast growing companies, let's imagine an app developer - we'll call it Fast Growth - with a ground-breaking new product.   FastGrowth can effectively become a global company from day one. Its product is distributed via app stores, so it has the potential to enter dozens of markets worldwide almost instantly. After launch, the product is a hit in the home market, and senior management decides to expand into five more countries within the region by the end of the month.   Accounts FastGrowth knows that launching into international markets means offering payment options in local currency via familiar methods, because consumers have come to expect this. FastGrowth wants to move rapidly, so it decides on opening bank accounts with a local bank in each country. The local banks are abundant and can open accounts in a few days.   Collections To facilitate the actual collection and movement of revenue from its app into the new accounts, FastGrowth chooses an established payment service provider. This requires no development and the provider’s solution is widely available, which allows FastGrowth to fully enter the new markets in just a couple of weeks. The provider even transfers all income in FastGrowth’s home currency, eliminating the need for FX conversion from the local accounts.",491
256,"  Scale At this point the company’s primary objective is scale. The app has been successful in 6 markets, and knowing that expansion can be achieved rapidly, the plan is to grow into 20 by the end of the year. The company starts adding a couple markets a month, in all different regions of the world. In a short time, FastGrowth has achieved a large international presence — but on the back of a complex and inefficient banking setup.   A year later, the cracks of the current setup start to show. With business booming, the CEO starts to ask the CFO for regular snapshots of the company’s finances. However, each time it takes the CFO over a week to find out balances across the numerous different banks they work with — and a lot can change in that time. The CEO grows frustrated with the delay; the CFO’s team grows frustrated with all of the manual effort that isn’t appreciated.   Moreover, FastGrowth has belatedly realized that by working with local banks it has few opportunities to introduce automation using channels such as host-to-host or API technology to facilitate integration into its ERP system. The automation can technically be done, but it would have to be replicated dozens of times over with the different banks, and it simply isn’t feasible.   Even for its operations staff to log in and make payments, a separate token and log-in is required, and each bank’s system varies slightly. The time differences don’t help either, as the headquarters can only rely on a small window of time where their collection provider and banks are all open at the same time.   On top of everything, an opportunity is being lost. With cash mostly sitting idle in every corner of the world, and no easy way to bring it all together, FastGrowth is missing out on the chance to easily invest or manage its excess liquidity.   With a dozen more markets on the horizon, growth is starting to be stressful rather than exciting. Is the current path sustainable? The CEO wonders how it all came to this.   What Difference Can a Banking Partner Make for a Digital Company?   Let's imagine a different future for FastGrowth, one in which they found a partner from the beginning that understood the importance of a long-term plan and also appreciated the need for speed.   FastGrowth has just launched in its home market and the app is a success. The next step is to roll out into five more markets by the end of the month.",497
257,"Instead of jumping straight to local banks, the company decides to call up a global banking partner…   Planning Ahead Citi sits down with the app developer to understand its vision. FastGrowth does not necessarily know the minutiae of which markets will be targeted and over what period of time, and it wants to leave space to respond rapidly to dynamic market conditions and moves by competitor firms — the digital space is fiercely competitive after all.   Nevertheless, like all digital companies, FastGrowth at least has long-term objectives at a high level. Citi learns that FastGrowth will not just launch into five more markets and stop. Eventually, the company wishes to expand beyond its home country and region. This information becomes invaluable and allows Citi to plan out the most efficient, relevant and cost-effective solutions.   Accounts For example, Citi suggests a non-account based solution for FastGrowth’s situation. Even if accounts with local banks are fairly easy to set up, there may not even be a need to have them at all. A non-account based solution would reduce complexity and lead to efficiency down the line as more markets are added, while achieving the same results of allowing FastGrowth to offer local payments.   Connectivity Working with a global bank rather than multiple local banks allows for better connectivity options as well. FastGrowth can choose to establish Host-to-Host connections with Citi or utilize an API, which it only has to build out once with one bank. The company can also rely on a single file type, rather than multiple. And no more drawers full of security tokens or phones full of token apps when expansion becomes a reality.   Collections & FX Citi also explains the benefits and drawbacks of using the existing payment service provider for collections. While it is tempting for FastGrowth to pay for an existing solution with built-in foreign exchange conversion, the exchange spread charged by the provider and the inability to control when FX is performed will limit FastGrowth in the end. Citi suggests keeping the funds in local currency instead until the time is optimal to convert. In five countries it may not make a difference, but in 20 the savings are significant.   Liquidity When it comes to liquidity, a multi-bank solution would reduce opportunities for optimal use of cash. Citi offers to implement a consolidated global structure that automatically moves money between company entities on an end-of-day basis. FastGrowth can then invest excess liquidity while still keeping capital available to local entities as required.",500

Fit for the future: getting people, digitization, globalization and consolidation rightOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Business & Professional Services CompaniesArticle30 Aug 2023Fit for the future: getting people, digitization, globalization and consolidation rightCommercial BankShareDOWNLOADThe world of business and professional services spans an extensive array of sectors, from IT and consulting to legal and tax. Despite its breadth, companies share many common characteristics and face some similar challenges and opportunities. Working with a bank that understands the common objectives of service sector companies can help you to achieve your goals. 1. People – prioritizing your key asset Recruitment and retention are key issues for business and professional services companies with labor markets in many countries still tight. Ensuring that employees are happy in their job is critical to future success. One key component of work satisfaction is competitive remuneration. Inflation has increased to levels which have not been seen in recent times for most countries; keeping pace is putting pressure on many companies’ costs. At the same time, business and professional services firms need to develop strategies to recruit new talent. Millennials and Gen Z have different attitudes towards work compared to previous generations. For instance, many younger workers consider work/life balance to be more important than financial reward. 2. Digitization – accelerating change Business and professional services companies are increasingly turning to digitization to improve their efficiency and agility. One example of a subsector that has undergone a digital transformation is staffing. In the past, staffing companies and employment agencies were a largely face-to-face and offline business, focused on job fairs, recruiters and offline advertising (print, radio and television). Now, technology plays an important part in operations via the development of online portals and marketplaces coupled with the deployment of software and social media, firms are able to enhance their reach to more candidates and employers. As a result, staffing firms have become vastly more efficient, with lower costs and much faster results for clients. Many other business and professional services have followed a similar tech-enabled transformation – particularly in Real Estate Services, BPOs, and Travel Services. 3. Globalization – creating opportunities and challenges Although the extent of overseas expansion varies significantly by sector within the business and professional services market, there is a growing trend of firms looking for opportunities internationally.",487
259,"Expanding into new markets offers the possibility of deploying successful business models into untapped geographies and the potential to lower costs through greater scale. However, to achieve their objectives, business and professional services firms need to differentiate themselves from competitors and prioritize investment in the components of their business model which separate them from the pack. Establishing a foreign subsidiary requires investment and can be quite time-consuming, which can deter companies from building global teams. At the same time, they may also need to adapt their operating models to account for cultural challenges and compliance risks when expanding overseas. 4. Consolidation – attractive to private equity One key theme in recent years has been accelerating consolidation of the business and professional services sector. Private Equity firms (attracted by the asset light nature of many service businesses) have acquired many companies and acted as a catalyst for broader change in the sector. By bringing in outside investors, services firms can gain an advantage over competitors as they have more financial capabilities for growth. 5. How we can help Many of the challenges and opportunities associated with people, digitization, globalization and consolidation are a core part of most business and professional services firms’ operational strategies. Working with the right bank can help companies to achieve their goals. At Citi, we offer a comprehensive range of treasury and financing solutions tailored to meet the ever-changing demands of our business and professional services clients. We recognize that businesses in the services sector operate in diverse industries and evolving markets. Understanding this, our dedicated relationship teams collaborate closely with you to grasp your strategic growth objectives across people, digitization, globalization, consolidation and address your unique banking and financing needs. For instance, companies looking to free up capital for investment in talent should first ensure that they are as efficient as possible. One way to do this is by fine tuning payment terms and centralizing treasury operations, including cash, risk and investment management. Combined, this can improve efficiency, lower costs, and free up cash that can go towards your people. Some banks can help more directly with employee recruitment and retention challenges. In select markets, Citi Commercial Bank partners with the Wealth at Work Organization within Citi Global Wealth, which meets the wealth management needs of mid-level and senior professionals in the business and professional services sectors.",450
260,"As well as providing personal banking services, investment strategies, mortgages and other tailored solutions, such as buy-in loans to facilitate partnerships (which are common across many sectors), Wealth at Work ensures that the company’s needs are also met, by taking a holistic view across cash management and other treasury services. When it comes to digitization, many companies are looking for transformative opportunities across both their core business and treasury functions, with the goal of driving efficiency and augmenting decision making. Citi has decades of experience in helping business and professional services firms to streamline their processes and improve visibility and control. We have dedicated teams who are focused on serving the needs of business and professional service firms and can help companies integrate their ERP and treasury management systems with our system through host-to- host connectivity to deliver greater automation, efficiency and security. With an on-the-ground presence in nearly 100 countries, Citi is well placed to facilitate the globalization of business and professional services firms. We provide valuable insights about best practices and local conditions as well as a full range of banking solutions. Despite a more volatile backdrop for private equity, interest is likely to remain strong. Companies should consider whether they intend to act as a consolidator of the sector – possibly bringing in an outside investor – or under what circumstances they would be a willing target. Citi has deep insights into the dynamics of the business and professional services sector and can advise companies on M&A and other opportunities, as well as providing guidance on valuation. Whether you require funds for recruitment and retention, are seeking inspiration for your digital transformation strategy, or are planning a global expansion or potential M&A, our team of banking specialists is ready to help support you throughout your journey and help you achieve your ambitions.

From AI to corporate venture capital: new trends are boosting Latin America’s digital transformation OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Digital Technology & Comms CompaniesArticle24 Oct 2023From AI to corporate venture capital: new trends are boosting Latin America’s digital transformation Commercial BankShareEmerging technologies are driving transformation within companies, including in Latin America, not only from the tech segment but also in traditional sectors that are seizing the opportunity to bolster their structures, transform and grow. This was highlighted at an event organized by Citi in Brazil, which brought together leading companies from across the region. From left: Jaime de Paula, from Abstrato Venture; Rodrigo Loffredo, from Citi; and Leo Monte, from Sinqia, listen to Raketo’s Fred Santoro in a discussion about Corporate Venture Capital, in a panel led by the Digital, Tech and Comms team of Citi Commercial BankPortuguêsDa IA ao Corporate Venture Capital: como novas tendências impulsionam a transformação digital na América Latina Tecnologias emergentes aceleram a transformação dentro das empresas, inclusive na América Latina, não apenas no segmento tecnológico, mas também em setores tradicionais que aproveitam a oportunidade para reforçar governança, se transformar e crescer. Esse foi o destaque em um evento organizado pelo Citi no Brasil, que reuniu líderes empresariais de diversos segmentos. Uma conhecida história dá conta de que, no fim do século XIX, uma empresa com posição de destaque no mercado global de telégrafos recebeu uma oferta para comprar a patente do telefone, então um novo invento, por US$ 100 mil. Mas o presidente da empresa desperdiçou a oportunidade, sem perceber que a nova tecnologia iria revolucionar as comunicações. Para evitar esse tipo de passo em falso, muitas empresas em toda a América Latina estão atentas às últimas tendências, como a inteligência artificial.",450
263,"Protagonistas do mundo corporativo latino-americano percebem que a transformação digital não está restrita a um setor específico; em maior ou menor grau, todos são impactados pelos novos desdobramentos digitais. Essa foi uma das conclusões alcançadas no evento 'Let's Talk Digital', organizado recentemente no Citi Brasil. Mais de 200 participantes de mais de 100 empresas do Brasil, ou com presença no país, discutiram temas como inteligência artificial, moedas digitais de bancos centrais (CBDC, na sigla em inglês) e Corporate Venture Capital (CVC). Um evento relevante não só para a região, como destaca André Cury, head do Citi Commercial Bank para Brasil e América Latina. “As empresas brasileiras de tecnologia são cada vez mais regionais e globais. Diferentemente das indústrias tradicionais, as empresas tecnológicas têm menos barreiras quanto buscam avançar ou se expandir para outros países. Entre nossos clientes, vemos uma série de empresas com espírito empreendedor que ganharam espaço para além da América Latina, chegando aos Estados Unidos, ou mesmo alcançando expansão fora do continente.” Capítulos extras na jornada digital Entre as lideranças das empresas do segmento Digital, Technology and Communications (D,T&C), há um consenso crescente de que a transformação digital é um processo contínuo, especialmente agora com mais ferramentas chegando às prateleiras. “As novas tecnologias, incluindo a inteligência artificial, adicionam capítulos à jornada de transformação digital das empresas”, resumiu Marco Stefanini, CEO e fundador da Stefanini, empresa brasileira presente em 41 países que ajuda empresas de diversos segmentos a implementar a transformação digital. Marco Stefanini destacou que a incorporação de ferramentas digitais é questão de “quando”, não de “se”. Frederico Braga, CFO da Omie, empresa brasileira de tecnologia que oferece soluções de gestão para empresas de diversos portes e segmentos, ecoou a visão de Stefanini.",478
264,"“Todos estão implementando e sendo influenciados por inovações e tecnologias em suas empresas. A Omie é uma empresa de tecnologia, portanto isso está enraizado em nossos processos, mas há novas tecnologias surgindo. A IA, por exemplo. Não há como escapar”. Para além da Inteligência Artificial, tendências como pagamentos digitais instantâneos, metaverso, ativos digitais e big data também estão no radar e apresentam oportunidades de diversificação de negócios. Novas oportunidades, desafios familiares Se por um lado as inovações catalisam desenvolvimento e crescimento, desafios de longa data ainda podem impor obstáculos à aceleração digital. É o caso, por exemplo, da infraestrutura de telecomunicações. “O desafio é levar conectividade a locais mais remotos, considerando que o Brasil é um país de dimensões continentais”, disse Rui Gomes, CEO da Um Telecom e presidente do Conselho da Connectoway. O uso correto dos dados, disse o empresário brasileiro João Vianna, também é um “pain point” para várias empresas. Ele acrescenta que quem “consegue gerenciar informação com o apoio de ferramentas avançadas pode fazer a diferença”. Vianna está agora por trás da Invisto, uma startup fundada por ele para criar oportunidades de investimento na reconstrução de residências familiares em locais privilegiados nos EUA. Soluções: Corporate Venture Capital e a independência para inovar Em busca da agilidade e autonomia necessárias para impulsionar a inovação, um caminho trilhado por diversas empresas é a criação de estruturas de Corporate Venture Capital (CVC). São iniciativas que utilizam a criatividade e a velocidade das startups para avançar no desenvolvimento de novas soluções, ou, segundo Fred Santoro, fundador da Raketo Venture Market, o CVC é uma “forma de grandes empresas permanecerem relevantes e sobreviverem em um mercado tecnológico em rápida mudança”.",479
265,"A empresa tecnológica brasileira Sinqia é uma das que vêm investindo em inovação por meio do CVC. A Torq, iniciativa de CVC da Sinqia, já acelerou o desenvolvimento de mais de 200 startups que trabalham com B2B, segundo Leo Monte, diretor da Torq. Ele afirma que a abordagem do CVC foi feita para impulsionar a inovação internamente, evitando as complexidades do setor financeiro. Mas liberar o potencial dos CVCs, dizem os líderes, requer atenção a fatores como o delicado equilíbrio entre a autonomia à empresa investida e um alinhamento sólido entre a corporação investidora e a startup. Jaime de Paula, empreendedor experiente que à frente da Abstrato Ventures, entre outras iniciativas, mencionou outro fator-chave para o sucesso de uma startup: os fundadores. “Eles fazem a diferença. Eles acreditam tanto no negócio que são vendedores.” A crença no poder dos empreendedores é tanta que, na Abstrato Ventures, analisa-se primeiro o perfil dos fundadores e, só depois, o potencial do negócio. Seja por meio de CVC ou por meio de desenvolvimentos internos, as empresas brasileiras de tecnologia se consolidam como players relevantes internacionalmente. Para as necessidades e esforços de expansão das empresas dos segmentos de D, T&C no Brasil, além de apoiar players digitais globais que atuam no país, o Citi Commercial Bank conta com uma equipe especializada que fornece serviços e soluções sob medida.",380
266,"“Nossos bankers têm profundo conhecimento e conexões no setor para apoiar nossos clientes em seus processos de tomada de decisão, encontrando as estruturas financeiras que melhor atendem às suas necessidades, fornecendo soluções financeiras e oportunidades para explorar os mercados de capitais, bem como compartilhando insights que podem ser úteis para o crescimento estratégico das empresas”, afirma Rodrigo Loffredo, Head de D,T&C do Citi Commercial Bank no Brasil.A well-known story says that at the end of the 19th century, a company holding a prominent position in the telegraph market was offered the patent for the telephone for US$ 100,000. But the company's president passed up the opportunity, not realizing that the new technology was going to revolutionize communications. To avoid this kind of faux-pas, many companies across Latin America have been proactively staying on top of the latest trends in technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence. There’s wide recognition that digital transformation is not restricted to a particular industry; to a greater or lesser extent, everyone is affected by technological change. This was one of the conclusions reached at the ‘Let’s Talk Digital’ event, hosted by Citi Brazil recently. Over 200 participants from over 100 companies from Brazil, or with a presence in the country, discussed topics such as artificial intelligence, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Corporate Venture Capital. An event relevant not only for Latin America, as the Citi Commercial Bank Head for Brazil and Latam, André Cury, highlights: “Brazilian technology companies are increasingly regional and global. Unlike traditional industries, tech companies have fewer barriers to entry when pursuing advancement or expansion to other countries. Among our clients, we see a number of companies with an entrepreneurial spirit that have expanded beyond Latin America, going to the United States, or even reaching global expansion beyond the Americas.”   Extra chapters in the digital journey Among the leadership of Digital, Technology and Communications (D,T&C) companies, there’s growing consensus that digital transformation is a continuous process, especially now with more tools available. “New technologies, including artificial intelligence, add chapters to the digital transformation journey of companies”, summarized CEO and founder, Marco Stefanini, from Stefanini, a Brazilian company present in 41 countries that helps companies from different segments to implement digital transformation.",491
267,"Marco Stefanini stressed that the incorporation of digital tools is a case of “when” not “if”. Frederico Braga, CFO of Omie, a tech company from Brazil that offers management solutions to firms of different sizes and segments, echoed Stefanini's vision. “Everyone is implementing and being influenced by innovation and technologies in their companies. Omie is a technology company, so this is rooted in our processes, but there are new technologies emerging. AI is a big topic. There is no way to escape: it is a matter of time and speed”. Putting AI to one side, trends such as instant digital payments, the metaverse, digital assets and big data are also on the radar and present business diversification opportunities. New opportunities, familiar challenges New innovations enable development and growth, yet familiar challenges can stand in the way of digital acceleration. This is the case, for example, in the telecommunications infrastructure sector. “The challenge is to bring connectivity to more remote locations, considering that Brazil is a country of continental dimensions”, said Rui Gomes, CEO of Um Telecom and chairman of the Board of Connectoway. The correct usage of data, said Brazilian entrepreneur João Vianna, is also a “pain point” for a number of companies. He adds that those who “manage to master information with the support of advanced tools can make a difference”. Vianna is now behind Invisto, a startup he found to create investment opportunities in family home re-construction in prime locations in the U.S. Solutions: Corporate Venture Capital and the independence to innovate In search of the necessary agility and autonomy to boost innovation, a path taken by several companies is setting up Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) structures. These are initiatives that use the creativity and speed of startups to advance the development of new solutions, or, according to Fred Santoro, founder of Raketo Venture Market, CVC is a “way for large companies to remain relevant and survive in a rapidly changing technological market”. The Brazilian tech company Sinqia is one of the companies that has been investing in innovation through CVC. Torq, Sinqia's CVC initiative, has already accelerated the development of more than 200 startups that work with B2B, according to Leo Monte, Director of Torq. He says that CVC approach was made to boost in-house innovation, as it avoids the complexity of the financial sector.",485
268,"global insights commercial bank from startup to scale up lessons from entrepreneurs. From startup to scale up: lessons from entrepreneursOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountEMEA digital leaders summit 2023Article17 Oct 2023From startup to scale up: lessons from entrepreneursCommercial BankShareThis article is based on a panel discussion held at Citi Commercial Bank’s EMEA Digital Leaders Summit 2023 held in Prague in September. Comments have been edited for brevity and clarity. Scaling up a company from a startup is exciting but presents numerous challenges. Baris Tezcan, Head of Citi Commercial Bank in Central Europe, talks to two business leaders about achieving goals. Successfully scaling a startup requires a combination of strategic planning, resource allocation, adaptability and investment in infrastructure and talent. It is also important to maintain the qualities that made your business successful in the first place. Growth is a dynamic process that often involves overcoming numerous obstacles along the way. Planning – combined with flexibility – pays off “When we launched in 2010, e-commerce was either facilitated by post offices or international logistics brands with limited domestic operations,” recalls Simona Kijonková, Founder and CEO of global logistics and e-commerce platform Packeta. Kijonková spotted a gap for domestic carrier networks that could connect brick and mortar shops and was able to grow very rapidly. “The key to successfully scaling was a constant focus on execution,” she says. Packeta now has more than 2,200 employees in eight countries. In the context of scaling a company, execution is the process of implementing the strategies, plans, and actions necessary to achieve growth and expansion goals. It is the practical and operational side of scaling, where you translate your vision and strategic decisions into tangible results. Execution is a critical component of the scaling process because even the best-laid plans can fail without proper implementation. Susan Repo, CFO at ICEYE, an earth observation data and solutions service provider that uses commercial satellites to provide space imagery to governments, insurance companies and other organisations, says that during rapid expansion, it can be tough not to get distracted. “Over the past two years, we have grown from 200 to 600 people. To do that successfully, we have had to keep our heads down and concentrate on execution and operations.” Having a clear strategic plan is essential if growth is to deliver the anticipated results.",486
269,"Your plan must include not only operational targets but also identification and assessment of financial, operational and compliance risks. “The importance of change management in relation to governance and legal matters is often underestimated,” says Repo. At the same time, adaptability is also important. “In my previous role at Tesla, the mission of the company was significantly expanded from electrification of transport to becoming a leading sustainable energy provider when SolarCity was acquired in 2016,” recalls Repo. “The strategic goals of the company evolved given the expansion into a different business segment. But the overall objective remained operational excellence to facilitate rapid scaling.” Getting the details right What might seem like unimportant minutiae in a small company can become major headaches in a large firm. For instance, in a small company, measurement and analysis may be straightforward. But once your firm grows, you need key performance indicators and metrics to track progress. Regular analysis and reporting helps you make data-driven decisions and adjust strategies as required. Similarly, effective communication becomes more complex in a larger organisation. Ensuring that information flows efficiently and that everyone is aligned with the company's goals and strategies is vital. “When we scaled up, we weren’t fully prepared for all the implications,” says Kijonková. “It took us a few years to realise that internal communications were critical. While operations had been similar in each country, practical day-to-day management at each depot was different and that created problems when they interacted with each other.” To scale up, Packeta needed to standardise not only communications, business processes and technology but also to centralise management. “It was hard for some people, especially older workers, to change but we took the time to explain to every employee at every office and depot why the changes were essential for our international growth,” says Kijonková. Increasing diversity delivers dividends For many companies, hiring the right talent is not just about finding individuals with a suitable skillset but about building a diverse organisation. Diversity brings together individuals with different backgrounds, perspectives, and life experiences and has a wide range of benefits. Diversity of thought can spark creativity and lead to innovative solutions to complex problems. When people from different backgrounds collaborate, they bring a wider range of ideas and approaches to the table. Similarly, diverse teams tend to make better decisions. They are more likely to consider a variety of viewpoints, challenge assumptions, and arrive at well-rounded conclusions. This can lead to more thoughtful and effective decision-making processes.",497
270,"global insights commercial bank funding that fits. Funding that fits: options for every stage of your company’s growthOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle21 Jun 2023Funding that fits: options for every stage of your company’s growthCommercial BankShareDOWNLOAD   Debt or equity? From a bank or the capital markets? When it comes to finding the right formula that enables your business to grow optimally, no two companies are the same – there is no onesize- fits-all capital structure. That said, our high growth clients often follow a natural sequence of lending solutions as they evolve; understanding common strategies may be helpful as you embark on your own growth journey. Assessing the implications of each financing option is more important than ever given macroeconomic headwinds that are impacting the cost of debt: inflation and interest rates have reached levels not seen in a decade, and investor scrutiny is intensifying. The funding choices described below are not prescriptive – companies can leapfrog to a strategy that suits them or forge their own path entirely. By understanding the options, you can plan and make the right choice for your company’s unique situation.Getting startedThe archetype of a start-up is an entrepreneur in their garage, growing their business with funds from family and friends. Even if the first part of this picture isn’t always the case, the second part is often close to the truth. Unless you are a tech start-up that takes on venture capital funding, it is common for new businesses to rely on small scale debt – whether that’s from family and friends, government programs, or an overdraft line with their account at a local bank.Working your capitalMany organizations move on to fund their growth through short-term working capital. Sales rise, and hopefully margins with them, freeing up cash to fund growth internally. Quite often, though, companies will have to pay suppliers sooner than they collect from customers. To accelerate growth, a short-term working capital loan can help address this timing mismatch and give you a flexible tool to continue your expansion.Investing in capacityAfter a while, many organizations decide to invest in capacity – such as a new factory, warehouse, office, or production facility – to supercharge growth. These kinds of expenditures can be sizeable and take time, so longer-term financing may be necessary.",474
271,"Bilateral term loans, with maturities that align more to the longer duration of the investment, are commonly used at this point of a company’s journey.Diversifying your fundsOnce companies reach a certain size, their funding requirements will exceed a level beyond what a single bank can provide. Organizations at this stage may also be interested in diversifying their sources of financing. In such situations, a club or syndicate of banks may come together to offer a more significant funding boost compared to what would be available from bilateral arrangements.Ringing the bell?At the upper end of the market, companies may conclude that their needs exceed what a bank – or even a group of them – can provide. When this happens, it’s time to think about options in the capital markets. Organizations may stick with debt and choose to issue bonds or could adopt the newer approach of seeking private institutional debt investors. However, many companies aspire to “ring the bell” and go public. An IPO is an important milestone event in a company’s growth journey, at which point it will typically have a sophisticated capital structure that enables it to tap into both private and public capital markets through a diversity of financial instruments.The capital structure questionOnce a company brings equity into the funding equation, the question of capital structure comes into play. What combination of debt and equity is optimal? How much debt capacity does the company have? We work with clients to help them tackle these questions and can benchmark a company’s working capital and debt structures against its peer group, discuss bank group strategies, explore the possibility of mergers and acquisitions, and review the firm’s target cost of capital. Although this stage represents mature commercial growth, the journey is far from over.Thinking ahead is key It’s common for Citi to work with entrepreneurs who can think two steps ahead for their business, but who are more uncertain about what their funding will look like at that point. The most successful organizations anticipate future inflection points and position themselves accordingly. For instance, if your business model requires 30-day payment terms for your suppliers, but you’re collecting from buyers in 90 days, it’s time to start thinking beyond what you can fund with internal working capital. And if syndicated lending might be valuable to fund future growth, it’s a good idea to start building relationships with banks early on.   In conclusion Companies are all different: some will never go through the funding stages described above.",485
272,"global insights commercial bank fx review interest rates back to the future . FX Review: Interest Rates — Back to the Future?OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Business & Professional Services CompaniesArticle26 Aug 2021FX Review: Interest Rates — Back to the Future?Commercial BankShareDownloadPortuguêsAfter a year of unprecedented central bank support, companies with multinational operations are keen to understand the likely path back to ‘normality’. When it comes to central bank policy rates, there is already a clear distinction between the major economies and emerging markets: inflation, and central banks’ credibility when it comes to managing it, will be the key variable.Figure 1 — Market Data   Once the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic became apparent, most countries adopted a similar playbook of fiscal support and sharply lower official interest rates. In many cases, official rates were cut to record low levels and often below prevailing inflation rates. But the situation has now changed. While the pandemic continues to ravage countries, the focus recently has been on lifting containment measures, spurring economic recovery and creating the conditions for a ‘return to normality’, accepting that the ‘new normal’ may be quite different from the old. So, what happens to interest rates in this environment?   Figure 2 — A Stylized View of Inflation   The key driver is inflation. Most countries experienced lower inflation last year; this year, inflation is generally higher and has increased sharply in a number of countries. How are central banks responding? Virtually all central banks expect that interest rates will increase as part of the return to normal; the issue is the timing and pace of increase.   Major Economies: Delay   Most central banks appear to regard inflation pressures this year as being temporary, arising from supply side problems rather than a resurgence in demand pressures. As such, there is the presumption that interest rate increases are not appropriate. This is the position of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which continues to forecast no change in interest rates until 2023[1] , though recent comments suggest that a scaling back of its quantitative easing program could happen before yearend. In effect, the Fed is basing its interest rate policy on the view that it should raise interest rates to normal levels once the economy has returned to normal. Other major central banks are adopting a similar approach – both in terms of interest rates and quantitative easing.",490
273,"Perhaps the key point is that the central banks of the main industrialized countries have credibility. Financial markets have accepted the view that the spike is abnormal and that inflation will return to normal levels over the next two years, while exhibiting differing views as to the precise timing of any changes.   Emerging Markets: A More Aggressive Response   The situation in emerging markets appears quite different. Most notably, the inflation propagation mechanism differs from developed economies. Many central banks face the same supply side inflation problems as their major developed economy counterparts but they do not have the same policy credibility. They cannot allow inflation to pick up without responding because of the risk that it becomes entrenched. Perhaps the best example is Brazil, where inflation has increased from a multi-decade low of just 1.88%[2] in May 2020 to a five-year high of 8.99% in July 2021. When the central bank started raising its benchmark rate (referred to as the Selic) in March — from 2.00% to 2.75% — its goal was to keep the rate below its ‘neutral’ level.[3] But, as inflation continued to increase, it shifted first to a neutral terminal rate and then, most recently, to a terminal rate above neutral.[4] Interest rates have already increased by 325 bps this year and the process is far from complete.    Russia is less extreme than Brazil, but the central bank has raised its benchmark rate by 225 bps to 6.50% since March in response to stronger inflationary increases.[5] The central banks of Latin American countries, such as Chile, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay, have increased rates (Mexico has done so twice) while Colombia is reported to be considering rate increases. In Central Europe, both the Czech Republic and Hungary are raising rates aggressively, while Poland has resisted any change despite inflation at a ten-year high of 5%, well above the 1.5%–3.5% target range. Inflationary pressures have been weaker in Asia, with customers less tolerant of price increases, but South Korea’s central bank is now reported to be considering a rate hike, which would be its first since November 2018.   Figure 3 — Brazil: Inflation vs.",464

Global banking relationship delivers visibility, control and efficiencyOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle07 Aug 2023Global banking relationship delivers visibility, control and efficiencyFormed in 2012, Precision Medicine Group is a life sciences services company supporting next-generation approaches to drug development and commercialization.Commercial BankShareDOWNLOAD The Challenge US-based Precision Medicine Group provides an integrated infrastructure that supports biopharmaceutical and life science companies as they develop and commercialize new products. Rapid organic growth and M&A activity meant it had different banks in 15+ markets across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Managing multiple bank relationships and accounts was time consuming. Each of the company’s banks required different tokens to log in, and a variety of inconsistent formats and processes for KYC and other compliance requirements. With this fragmented banking structure, Precision Medicine’s cash visibility was limited, making it difficult to assess cash positions. Determining balances required local teams to pull data manually by logging into one of the multiple banking platforms and summarizing the data in an Excel file. Precision Medicine decided to consolidate international banking with a single global partner as part of an initiative to increase centralization. The company wanted consistent solutions and service levels, greater visibility and control of cash, and to free up local teams to focus on core activities rather than bank account management. The Solution Precision Medicine selected Citi Commercial Bank as its global banking partner based on Citi’s presence in nearly 100 countries and jurisdictions worldwide, which aligned with the company’s existing operations and strategic ambitions. Given its long healthcare industry experience and specific expertise in working with contract research organizations, Citi was well placed to help Precision Medicine navigate its centralization journey. Citi and Precision Medicine’s objective was to create a best-in-class global treasury function. To achieve this, Citi developed a scalable treasury roadmap to take the company to its desired future state in phases: Consolidate banking relationships worldwide to Citi Commercial Bank, rationalizing accounts where possible. Increase automation and improve liquidity management. A key part of Precision Medicine’s centralization strategy is the introduction of a new ERP system, which will have full host-to-host connectivity with Citi. The Result Citi opened all new accounts for Precision Medicine within their project timeline, including new entities that were added after the original project scope was set.",487
275,"Account openings used digital onboarding to ensure a consistent process across all jurisdictions, which significantly reduced the resources required to manage the process. Citi provided support and a single global contact to address Precision Medicine’s queries. Precision Medicine uses CitiDirect to manage its accounts, giving it visibility and control of cash globally via a single dashboard. The company enjoys the benefits of Citi Payment Insights, which provides payment status updates via a visual tracker. Precision Medicine also uses the SEPA Debtor Mandates module within CitiDirect, enabling it to self-manageits Euro Zone SEPA debtor mandates and prevent unapproved transactions. All this has freed up individuals at Precision Medicine entities worldwide to focus on their core roles, as well as improve risk management. With phase one now complete, Precision Medicine and Citi have embarked on phase two. The company has introduced its new ERP system, which is being integrated via host-to-host connectivity with Citi to improve control and reduce manual effort. As part of the ERP integration, Precision Medicine and Citi have developed an XML file to accommodate payment instructions for multiple countries, currencies, and payment types, which will be sent directly from the company’s ERP to Citi. Precision Medicine is also using CitiConnect File Manager to allow it to review batch payment files before processing. The company also intends to take advantage of its consolidated bank relationship with Citi and new functionality to move cash between entities more efficiently.

Good connections: navigating supply chain challengesOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle11 Dec 2023Good connections: navigating supply chain challengesCommercial BankShareHow one company bridged the gaps during its international expansion.*This partner content was produced by the Financial Times on behalf of Citi Commercial Bank Regardless of sector, when the smooth running of organizations is discussed, a quote attributed to US General Omar Bradley is often employed: “Amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics.” A company could sell the best, most innovative product or solution, underpinned by a brilliant marketing strategy, but if the logistics for delivering the goods aren’t optimal then that company will underperform. Martin Christopher, Emeritus Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, and author of the bestselling book Logistics and Supply Chain Management, concurs: “The real competition in business sectors is between supply chains, not companies.” This critical battleground is particularly tricky for the pharmaceutical industry. Stringent regulatory compliance and complex approval processes can lead to product launch delays and supply chain disruption. End-to-end supply chain visibility, while desirable for mitigating risks and optimizing operations, is often difficult to ensure.As detailed in this 2022 study by EY, the global nature of pharmaceutical distribution, usually involving various external partners, makes for a complex mix of worldwide shipping solutions across ocean, air and cross-border trucking. Integrating shipping data across these solutions can be hugely challenging and costly. Add in supplier supervision, geopolitical and trade considerations – plus the pharma-specific requirement that is cold-chain management (ensuring goods are kept at the correct temperature) – and it is clear that the sector requires world-beating supply-chain organization. A specific set of challenges Fast-growing Taiwan-based biopharmaceutical company PharmaEssentia is one firm that can attest to the logistical challenges of operating a globally expanding pharmaceutical business. The Covid-19 pandemic, for example, saw PharmaEssentia potentially heading for supply problems as the worldwide demand for items such as syringe barrels skyrocketed. “Like many pharmaceutical and biotech companies, we rely on different CMOs (contract manufacturing organisations) and suppliers,” says Samuel Lin, PharmaEssentia’s VP, Head of Business Operations and Strategy. “During Covid, we were asked to share commoditised components like these with vaccine manufacturers.",493
277,"So we had to ensure we had sufficient stock to guarantee a stability of service to our customers and, ultimately, to patients.” For business continuity, PharmaEssentia turned to its global banking partner, Citi Commercial Bank, for an injection of working capital, helping the firm to carry on providing innovative medicines to patients in dire need. Laura Fogarty, Citi Commercial Bank’s Healthcare Industry Head in North America, agrees that this was essential in order to avoid shipping disruption. “There was a lot going on at the time,” she says. “Around November 2021, at the height of the pandemic, PharmaEssentia had received approval across much of the world for its lead drug candidate BESREMi, a biologic used to treat a rare blood disease. It was also launching in the US, and all of that required significant investment. Our working capital solution provided the company with the financial flexibility it needed to maintain its core business while ensuring the US launch of BESREMi was a success.” Local market knowledge is essential Ko-Chung Lin, PharmaEssentia’s founder and CEO, points out that Citi’s global footprint – together with a deep knowledge of local markets – helped it weather the storms of Covid-19 and ensure a robust supply chain, as well as funding further commercialisation in global markets. “Citi gave us solutions and dynamics for different markets,” he says. “They didn’t just help with capital but also in an advisory capacity. We are essentially a group of scientists – that’s our focus – and Citi brought the financial expertise we needed.” To support the market expansion of PharmaEssentia’s lead product, BESREMi, Citi helped the firm raise capital through the issuance of global depository receipts in Luxembourg. Tapping the overseas markets allowed PharmaEssentia to elevate its brand recognition, as well as obtain access to new investors. In April 2023, this was the largest overseas offering at the time by a Taiwanese healthcare issuer. Citi also introduced a “host-to-host” solution to automate payment flows and create better operational efficiencies. “Host-to-host allows full automation of files – sending and processing without the need for manual intervention,” explains Fogarty. Ko-Chung Lin describes that future forecast trajectory as “hockey stick growth”, with more investment and the hiring of many more talented scientists ultimately resulting in a greater number of successful patient treatments.",487
278,"global insights commercial bank healthcare and life sciences companies operating in china finding the right cash repatriation strategy. Healthcare and life sciences companies operating in China: finding the right cash repatriation strategyOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle28 Jun 2023Healthcare and life sciences companies operating in China: finding the right cash repatriation strategyCommercial BankShareDOWNLOAD   China is the world’s second largest healthcare market1 and is therefore a priority for many US healthcare and life sciences companies, whether for sales, research and development, or manufacturing. But managing cash generated in China can be challenging as regulations, especially relating to local currency, are stricter and more complex than the US or European countries, for example.   Selecting the right strategy for the repatriation of cash may not seem a priority for US companies when they are setting up operations in China; after all, generating revenue in healthcare and life sciences can take several years after gaining regulatory approval to operate. Nevertheless, cash repatriation is critical and should be carefully thought through before a local entity is established and certainly well in advance of generating cash.   It’s important for companies to be aware of the various options for repatriating cash – and tailor their strategies accordingly – to ensure cash repatriation is as efficient and effective as possible. As importantly, no company wants to risk being fined for breaching regulations or suffer the reputational damage – and possible restrictions on their activity in China – that might follow from such a breach.   What options are available? Chinese regulators impose a variety of rules and requirements on the movement of funds from China, prohibiting the use of some methods of repatriation that may be commonplace in other jurisdictions and placing strict caps in other circumstances. Nevertheless, with careful planning, US companies can take advantage of three principal repatriation structures that can meet a variety of needs for companies at different stages of development.   Dividend remittance is the most common strategy for most US healthcare and life sciences companies operating in China. Dividends are a one-way transfer of funds and are simple to execute: there are no restrictions on the use of dividends and no need to return funds to China at a later date. As execution is straightforward, and no regulatory approvals are required when remitting dividends, the strategy is valuable even for companies with limited treasury resources. Dividends can be adopted as both a near and long-term repatriation solution.",498
279,"Healthcare companies will need to pay withholding tax to the local tax bureau, so it is important to consider the impact of this on P&L when repatriating funds. Cross-border lending from China involves more complex structures than dividend remittance and may be more applicable to companies with greater treasury resources or more sophisticated treasury arrangements. While companies must register with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) or with banks in certain pilot areas in order to lend cross-border, specific regulatory approval is not required. Execution is both straightforward and can be completed on a timely basis. Cross-border lending is subject to a number of requirements, however. Repatriated funds can only be used for working capital and lending cannot exceed more than 50% of the China entity’s equity, limiting the ability of a US company to extract surplus renminbi from China. The tenor of lending is subject to the underlying lending contract tenor. Cross-border pooling is a more complex arrangement for repatriating funds and is typically applicable for healthcare or life sciences companies with regional or global treasury hubs that utilize sophisticated structures to optimize liquidity management. Cross-border pooling requires registration or filing with local regulators and offers flexible borrowing/lending quotas. Self-generated funds can be swept offshore and then freely converted to other currencies. Certain foreign currency pooling structures do not include a regulatory repayment period and the tenor can be stipulated in the underlying loan agreement that is filed with regulators. Pooling structures can also evolve as required: new entities can be added to the pool as companies’ China business grows. While cross-border pooling offers many benefits, it is complicated to set up and execute and there are a variety options available, including programs administered by SAFE and China’s central bank (the People’s Bank of China) and a program for companies that operate in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. In addition, repayment of RMB is required within 12 months under certain structures. Consequently, currencies may need to be converted twice when funds are lent and repaid, potentially increasing costs. Choosing the right banking partner For US healthcare and life sciences companies, the attractions of the world’s second largest healthcare market are clear. However, companies need to be aware of the challenges associated with repatriating cash from China and plan accordingly. While companies’ needs may evolve as their operations in the country grow, it is essential to identify appropriate strategies well in advance of generating revenue in China.",484
280,"global insights commercial bank healthcare ipos treasurys role before the bell. Healthcare IPOs: Treasury's Role Before the BellOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle12 Apr 2022Healthcare IPOs: Treasury's Role Before the BellCommercial Bank·ContributorsShareDownloadLife Sciences companies are unique not only in how quickly they scale, but also how early they go public in their life cycle. Listing on a stock exchange is usually a momentous milestone for a business, and for months leading up to it, attention understandably turns almost exclusively to the IPO process, investor roadshows, and ringing the opening bell. What often gets overlooked is the importance of an automated, efficient treasury setup. Getting this right not only delivers a major boost for a healthcare company’s operations in general, but in many cases is necessary to meet the increased expectations and scrutiny that comes with being a public entity.Once the bell rings, expectations from investors, regulators and other key stakeholders become significantly higher, essentially overnight. However, the internal transformation needed to meet these heightened expectations cannot always happen as quickly. Ideally, a life sciences company should begin preparations up to a year before the IPO is anticipated. Key to these preparations is a review of treasury operations and the creation of a system that facilitates the strong governance, transparency, and accountability that stakeholders expect.   Governance: Laying the Foundations All companies, public or private, have a policy that sets out the rules (or governance) for each team across the organization and how that organization functions. It is acceptable and understood that the governance structure of a private company is more fluid than that of a public one, especially for healthcare or life sciences companies that are often growing rapidly, and in a decentralized way. Once that company takes on public funding, however, it is held to a higher standard in order to protect investors, and the same fluidity is no longer tolerated. New infrastructure and processes may be required to fulfill key tasks. Understanding the scope of the changes that need to be made before an IPO can be daunting. Many of the requirements associated with becoming a public company are prosaic but absolutely critical in order to ensure best practices. If the firm has a bank that understands the journey, they can jointly conduct a detailed survey of their treasury practices across multiple areas; answering questions early on – even the seemingly mundane ones – will have a beneficial impact at later stages.",489
281,"For example: Encryption: At a basic level, companies must establish security encryption protocols for payments, setting out whether they intend to encrypt connectivity to their bank or both connectivity and payment files. The bank can help the company decide what makes the most sense in its specific circumstances. Authorized Signers: Especially when a healthcare company has multiple overseas subsidiaries, it may have a variety of practices related to authorized signers. To ensure proper controls, healthcare companies should keep their signer list updated, and consider a centralized structure that leaves room for local signatories where relevant. The bank will be able to provide detailed guidance on issues such as authorized signatory requirements in various jurisdictions. Investment Policy: Raising cash is the primary objective of an IPO, but many firms fail to build a plan for how to manage that cash once it arrives, with some maintaining balances in a demand deposit account. The asset management arm at the bank can work with the company to understand its priorities and develop an investor policy statement and strategy that balances risk and return with any strategic projects such as investment in new facilities and research and development. Explore this topic further here. Cash Deployment: Proceeds from Healthcare IPOs may be used to fund subsidiaries to expand operations, conduct clinical trials, and repay debt. Separate from the investment policy for any excess balances, a healthcare company should think about how it will deploy cash for these various purposes in the most efficient way. A centralized banking operation streamlines funding at the headquarters rather than individually at each subsidiary, enabling greater visibility and control. Some banks might be able to help their clients automatically implement their governance policies, such as the authorization process for electronic payments. Authorization at the ERP level when releasing file payments is the most common, but banks can support additional authorizations as well. FX transactions, for example, may be more sensitive than regular payments, and so Healthcare companies can have defined processes and employees to input and authorize those particular transactions. Such procedures and processes make it easier to ensure robust governance.   Transparency: The Key to Building Trust In addition to necessitating stronger governance, accessing the capital markets requires increased financial reporting capabilities to ensure greater transparency for stakeholders. Treasury has an obligation to consolidate and report ongoing financial data relating to key trial developments. If the company cannot easily synthesize information across the organization and provide granular reporting, it should consider building the infrastructure upfront to avoid wasting time later on.",476
282,"The international nature of the life sciences and healthcare sector complicates this further; companies often expand rapidly to conduct clinical trials in Asia and Europe in order to commercialize products to these key markets. Similarly, companies may launch operations in a new market to benefit from R&D credits or tax incentives in places such as Australia. If companies work with multiple providers or correspondent banks in different countries, they will need to negotiate a variety of processes, formats and reports, increasing complexity and making it harder to consolidate the necessary information. Working with a global bank that can easily scale with the company can solve some of these problems. Consolidation provides much greater control over the data that companies receive into their ERP system, making reporting fast and accurate even as they add incremental countries. Relevant data can then be efficiently mapped for each project or drug.   Accountability: Oversight is Critical The importance of accountability cannot be overstated: accurate reporting to Wall Street is essential. The treasury policies and procedures put in place as part of the governance structure described earlier can help with accountability and regulatory compliance, but much more is required. For instance, companies must adhere to the target capital structure that they communicate to stakeholders. Company management will define the ideal debt/equity ratio, but it is the treasury team that takes responsibility for the actual execution of the plan and management of the day-to-day flow of cash, by repaying debt and partnering with capital markets bankers to ensure an appropriate funding structure is in place. In terms of compliance, being publicly listed transforms the regulatory burdens placed on companies. Following an IPO, a company must be in compliance with a number of regulations, which can have significant treasury and operational implications. For example, some regulations require companies to perform audits on their bank account balances or to report their tax compliance status, FX exposure, and interest rate exposure. A company’s bank should have the infrastructure to enable this. The collation of such information, which is documented in MT940 and other message types as well as cash management statements, is significantly easier if a company works with a single bank. Similarly, a bank can provide simplified reporting of FX and interest rate exposure that can be fed into the company’s ERP system, automatically populating accounting statements.   Conclusion: Preparation is Essential An IPO is a marquee event in a healthcare company’s growth trajectory, and many factors need to go right in order for it to succeed.",478

Managing rising interest rates and high inflation has been top of mind for treasurers and corporate treasury teams as many seek solutions to minimize the impacts of margin compression.   The Fed increased rates by 25bps on March 22 with the Bank of England following suit on March 23. In his March 22, 2023 press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated, “The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy” and had the view that tightening credit conditions could quell the need for future hikes1.   Amid a decrease in consumer spending, inventory management has become less efficient over the last two years due to a shift from “just in time” to “just in case” as a tool for countering supply chain disruption. Sellers are tasked with holding more inventory financed at their own cost of capital on behalf of their customers. Credit spreads between investment grade (IG) and high yield (HY) rated companies widened at the outset of the Fed’s hiking cycle and underscored the importance of sellers having access to liquidity at efficient rates.   Corporates have focused on working capital for the last 15+ years and are very active in managing payment terms. Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) has lengthened by an average of nine days since 2014 for S&P 1500 listed companies (see chart below). Exiting the pandemic, companies have found ways to lower Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) by launching receivable finance programs and participating in supply chain finance programs to counter buyers requesting longer payment terms.   1 FRB, Chair Powell’s Press Conference, 2023   How Citi can support sales and customer resiliency while managing DSO & credit exposure With the varied financial conditions over the last three years, customers are seeking flexible and longer payment terms.",492
291,"Sellers can leverage accounts receivable financing to potentially inject liquidity into sales distribution channels while managing DSO. For example, today a large consumer and industrial goods manufacturer utilizes a structured AR finance program in addition to commercial paper to provide their business with liquidity.

How eCommerce Companies Can Scale With EaseOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle21 Dec 2021How eCommerce Companies Can Scale With EaseCommercial BankShareDownloadThe ecommerce landscape has been growing exponentially over the last few years, with global industry revenues rising to $2.7 trillion USD in 2021. New entrants continue to disrupt existing business models as they find novel ways of reaching the customer. With growth only accelerating during the pandemic and projected to reach $3.5 trillion USD by 2025, companies in this industry must be extremely nimble and ready to scale at a moment’s notice. The problem: is their banking able to keep up?Managing exponential collection growth Ecommerce companies tend to handle ever larger volumes of incoming payments, sometimes up to thousands per month, which are often much more granular and data-rich than those from other industries. Especially for companies in the Business to Consumer (B2C) industry, collecting these payments at scale, which can occur at both regular and irregular intervals, is a key challenge that becomes even more difficult when trying to collect from international customers. They also need to do so safely, reliably, and efficiently in order to fulfill their orders. Some companies find that they need to dedicate precious time and resources to the process, which impacts their returns. Citi understands that this can be a source of pain for ecommerce companies, and so we have developed solutions that simplify the collections process. There are usually 3 common problems that we can help overcome: The need to efficiently collect payments at scale: Our proprietary platforms allow clients to simply turn on the functionality to collect hundreds, even thousands of payments without having to build their own infrastructure. These solutions integrate seamlessly with client browsers, settle incoming payments, and offer robust reporting and reconciliation features The need to offer multiple currency options: To remain competitive, ecommerce companies need to allow customers across the globe to pay in their local currencies. Our FX solutions generate guaranteed pricing so that currency conversions can be locked in instantly, mitigating the risk of large exchange rate fluctuations The need to reconcile the large volume of incoming payments: Finding a mechanism to collect payments at scale is one challenge, but then reconciling those thousands of incoming transactions to the buyers who initiated them is a separate one entirely.",471
294,"We’ve developed a solution that leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to automate the reconciliation process, so that companies can free up resources for other functions   Managing exponential payment growth Managing the incoming transactions is hard enough, but every ecommerce player will also have to account for the outgoing flows to the end merchants, which can occur in equally large volumes  – again up to thousands per month. Many of these payments may need to go to cross-border suppliers in multiple currencies, and get sent through local payment rails, which could add significantly to the complexity of their operations. The number of intermediaries in the flow will also impact both the cost and settlement timeframe of the transactions. Given the aggregator/ intermediary role played by most ecommerce platforms, high payment handling costs impact the profit margins of these entities. Like with incoming payments, ecommerce entities also need to be able to track the status of these outgoing payments in an easy-to-access way. Citi has developed solutions to manage through the common challenges of outgoing payments: The need to make payments in different currencies without increasing complexity: Instead of creating accounts for each foreign currency payment, which often entails multiple banking partners, or working with costly FX providers, our non-account-based solution allows for companies to make 135+ currency payments from a single funding currency The need to securely transact and avoid fraud: Many ecommerce companies facilitate millions of transactions each year, and so maintaining security of those transactions and avoiding fraud is a very daunting task. We utilize detection and prevention technologies to keep our clients’ money safe, and offer additional security features that can be configured to suit their business The need to have payment format options: Certain ecommerce companies, particularly Online Travel Aggregators (OTAs), need to collect a credit card payment and pass that format of payment on to the end merchants. It’s not feasible to create and manage a traditional cards program for every merchant, on top of all the other wire transfers and other payment types that need to be made, so real-time virtual card issuance, managed through low-touch API connectivity, is a major benefit to these companies   The ecommerce landscape shows no sign of slowing down, and we expect to see new entrants popping up regularly for the foreseeable future. When these companies scale up, we’ll be there to help them navigate their growth priorities. If your company is prepping for that exponential growth, and you want to move as fast as possible, talk to us today to learn more about how we can help.",493

How Nonprofits Can Get Greater Value From Their DonationsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for NonprofitsArticle02 Mar 2021How Nonprofits Can Get Greater Value From Their DonationsCommercial BankShareDownloadThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced many nonprofits to rethink how they collect donations. Electronic solutions can improve donor convenience and ensure that donations make a greater contribution to the organization’s mission.Events such as golf tournaments and galas are important fundraising opportunities for nonprofit organizations. Many nonprofits also receive large volumes of mailed checks. Since COVID-19 struck, these sources of funds have come under pressure. Lockdowns, continuing in many areas a year on from the start of the pandemic, have prompted the cancellation of most fundraising events. Concerns about standing in line at the post office have reduced the number of mailed checks, while places of worship that rely on cash collections have seen lower attendance (assuming they have remained open). To compound the challenge faced by nonprofits, remote working has made the administrative tasks associated with processing donations more difficult to manage. At the same time, the fall in donations has occurred against a backdrop of increased demand for the services that many nonprofits provide. Charitable organizations offering healthcare services, mental health support or poverty alleviation have been especially important over the past year given the challenges many people have experienced as a result of COVID-19. A number of nonprofits have pivoted successfully to virtual and online events to raise funds during COVID-19 lockdowns: there has been unprecedented creativity within the sector. Moreover, some nonprofits have been able to collect donations via phone or on their website via PayPal or another payment processing service. However, such collections have always been problematic for nonprofits given interchange fees of up to 3% and additional costs for credit card processing: given the small donations that many nonprofits receive, such charges can have a big impact on revenues. Historically, there has been limited use of lower cost ACH payments because it has been cumbersome to implement the necessary functionality. Offering a flexible electronic solution Citi’s Present and Pay solution was originally designed to help companies struggling to get their customers to pay their invoices on time or by a preferred payment method. This comprehensive electronic invoice solution helps solve this problem. Present and Pay allows companies’ customers to view, download, dispute and pay invoices online.",484
296,"However, Citi quickly saw the possibilities of this innovative technology to accommodate nonprofits, which often receive small donations. With the onset of the pandemic, Present and Pay’s capabilities have become even more attractive for nonprofits. Present and Pay works via a secure web portal for the end to end transaction and donation process, including encrypted bank and card information. Crucially, depending on the package, the portal can be fully customizable with the option to integrate in the nonprofit's own website with its own branding. Research shows that donors may abandon the donation process because of cybersecurity concerns if they are transferred to a third-party site. With Present and Pay, the donor can simply click the ‘donate now’ button on the company’s website, and choose how they would like to pay. Nonprofits can choose from a variety of payment options on Present and Pay, including ACH and credit card. Present and Pay helps nonprofits maximize revenue and minimize costs by reducing time and effort for staff to collect donations, and reducing expenses related to other receivables setup and fees. Both one-off and recurring donations can be accommodated by Present and Pay. In addition, nonprofits can enable donors to create a profile that allows them to see a record of their donations, which improves convenience when donors are completing their tax returns, for instance. Delivering longer-term benefits Present and Pay offers immediate advantages to nonprofits by providing them with a cost-effective way to collect donations: it has been especially useful during the pandemic. However, the solution also has a number of additional benefits that should ensure it remains a valuable addition to nonprofits' toolkit in the long-term. Many nonprofits have limited resources: staff, who may be volunteers, often multi-task, taking responsibility for fundraising, event management, marketing and many other functions. Present and Pay can be fully automated, reducing nonprofits' administrative burden, potentially lowering costs or freeing up staff time for more valueadded activities. Present and Pay offers an administrator portal that enables nonprofit staff to easily facilitate a donation taken via telephone. Users can also generate at-a-glance reports, making audits straightforward. Present and Pay is flexible with packages of varying complexity, allowing nonprofits to tailor the solution and integration with their other systems to their requirements. Nonprofits' commitment to innovation and creativity have been evident when it comes to fundraising during the COVID-19 pandemic; many have achieved incredible results despite extremely challenging circumstances. By adopting Present and Pay, nonprofits have an opportunity to achieve a similar transformation of their donations process.",495

How tech firms can turbocharge transition to sustainable futureOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountEMEA digital leaders summit 2023Article31 Oct 2023How tech firms can turbocharge transition to sustainable futureCommercial BankShareThis article is based on a panel discussion held at Citi Commercial Bank’s EMEA Digital Leaders Summit 2023 held in Prague in September. Comments have been edited for brevity and clarity. Rashmi Ghai, Head of Sustainability & ESG at Citi Commercial Bank, talks to three digital companies that are leveraging technology to improve the environment and people’s lives. While technologies such as solar power and electric vehicles are clearly critical to reducing carbon emissions, there are many other less obvious ways that digital technology can address ESG challenges. A myriad of purpose-led companies has sprung up to develop solutions that can have a real impact on some of the world’s greatest problems. “The digital and technology sector has a unique opportunity to accelerate the transition to a sustainable and equitable future.” Explains Rashmi, Head of ESG at Citi Commercial Bank. Some examples of these technology-based solutions like carbon emissions foot printing, carbon emissions accounting & reporting, supply chain technology, and Fin Tech platforms focusing on financial inclusion were discussed by her with three Citi Commercial Bank digital clients. Why clarity is critical One of the challenges for purpose-led companies trying to deliver an environmental or social impact is quantifying the scale of the problem they seek to solve. They need to identify, or source, relevant data, and ensure that it is reliable, consistent and verifiable. The seafood sector highlights the scale of the challenge. The global market is worth $1.8 trillion a year and is relied on by two thirds of the world’s population as a primary source of protein or for income. Yet the seafood supply chain is notoriously opaque and inefficient: waste can reach 45% in emerging markets and even in developed countries, it is as much as 25%. As many as one in four seafood items is mislabelled or misdated. Seafood Souq, a digital platform with a whole of industry approach for the global seafood market. They have developed the end-to-end digital infrastructure for the supply chain, covering trade, traceability, payments and data, and was established to boost quality, protect stocks and improve fishers’ livelihoods.",492
298,"“By sourcing the right data, we can connect buyers with suppliers, eliminate wastage, and bring traceability to the supply chain – which reduces opportunities for fraud,” explains Sean Dennis, CEO & Co-Founder. Data is also at the heart of Moove, which provides finance to gig workers in the mobility industry in both developed and developing markets. “We do workshops and surveys to understand drivers’ pain points, focused not just on financing but also lifestyle issues such as the cost of living, household dependents and other relevant considerations,” says Tingting Peng, Chief Capital, Strategy and Impact Officer. These insights inform the products and solutions that Moove develops. The need for action to reduce emissions to slow climate change is gaining momentum and being translated into requirements for companies to act. “Corporates in Europe – and in the near future, in California – are being asked to produce auditable greenhouse gas emission figures,” says Ellen Moeller, Head of Europe at enterprise climate platform Watershed. “These figures will be the basis for plans to reduce emissions. But for many companies, the task remains ill-defined and cutting through the noise is tough.” Watershed effectively provides a turnkey solution, enabling corporates to measure carbon emissions, both from their own operations and their supply chain, report them, identify effective actions, and communicate these to the board and to customers.   Making an impact Identifying and quantifying problems is not enough – purpose-led organisations must also find ways to mitigate them and demonstrate the effectiveness of their solutions. More than 50% of the gig workers Moove is targeting worldwide have been denied access to financial services, and in regions such as Africa more than 90% of people have never had access to credit. “As gig workers have no employment contracts, they are invisible to traditional financial institutions,” explains Peng. Moove uses mobility workers’ productivity to underwrite their credit risk, giving them access to credit for the first time, a path to asset ownership and a sustainable income. Moove is also helping to facilitate the move to electrification: 60% of the vehicles it finances are electric vehicles and it invests in charging infrastructure. As a result of its research into gig workers’ needs, Moove has broadened its range of offerings. For example, it has rolled out health insurance for Uber drivers in sub-Saharan Africa and India that covers dependents, which is a key requirement for drivers, most of whom are male and aged between 25 and 45.",501
299,"Seafood Souq’s work with both suppliers and buyers has produced impressive results. “We worked with fishers in countries including Oman who caught tuna, and in the absence of an establish cold chain to markets, sold it to local traders for well under market value. Seafood Souq worked with an NGO to train the fishers to use pole and line practices and established a carefully monitored cold chain. As a result, the fishers are now able to secure true market value and consequently catch fewer fish,” says Dennis. On the buyer side, Seafood Souq works with a well-known hotel in the UAE that sought to source only certified seafood as part of its ESG strategy. “We audited around 400 products it bought and found enormous amounts of fraudulent discrepancies in certifications and mislabelling says Dennis. Seafood Souq built a sustainability dashboard for the hotel group, monitoring product credentials and validating its ESG performance. There can be a tendency to view ESG as simply a cost, but Moeller at Watershed says it can generate positive returns on investment. “For instance, moving to cloud data centres powered by renewable power improves efficiency and reduces emissions,” she notes. “A robust ESG strategy can also open up access to lower cost sustainable financing.” In summary, Rashmi from Citi explains how Supply chain technology platforms are scaling up to address seafood traceability and creating a safer and more equitable ecosystem, a mobility Fin tech platform is providing more including financing and access to greener vehicles, and an integrated carbon management platform is helping businesses create impact and accelerate their transition.   UP NEXTArticleFrom startup to scale up: lessons from entrepreneursCommercial BankArticleHow to get tech M&A rightCommercial BankSeriesEMEA digital leaders summit 2023Commercial BankLearn more about Commercial Bank at Citi or contact usTo help us put you in contact with the right person, please answer the following questions.* Are you an existing client with us?SelectRead Citigroup Privacy NoticesbacknextSubscribeSign up to receive our newsletter providing a roundup of recent content and updates on new reports.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",460

How to get tech M&A rightOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountEMEA digital leaders summit 2023Article01 Nov 2023How to get tech M&A rightCommercial BankShareThis article is based on a panel discussion held at Citi Commercial Bank’s EMEA Digital Leaders Summit 2023 held in Prague in September. Comments have been edited for brevity and clarity.   Growing inorganically has always been a key strategy for technology companies but it’s important to manage the risks, write Yishai Fransis, Head of EMEA Technology Investment Banking at Citi and Piotr Tyminski, EMEA Industry Head of Digital, Tech and Comms at Citi Commercial Bank. It is widely accepted that at least half of all M&A transactions fail, and some studies suggest more than 70% fail to create value. Moreover, both the macroeconomic and financial market environment has changed over the past 18 months, creating additional potential challenges. Even when M&A transactions are successful, gaining credit for them from investors (for listed companies) has always been tough. Yet if you can avoid potential pitfalls, acquisitions can deliver significant rewards. What’s the driver? A key way to help ensure the success of an M&A transaction is to have a clear framework to evaluate the deal. Typically, acquisitions are to gain access to product, technology, talent or new markets – or a combination of these factors. Scale is also an important motivation, as it allows firms to generate cost synergies by sharing resources. Romania’s largest listed IT company Arobs has completed nine acquisitions since its IPO in 2021.  “Our company has two business lines, products and services,” explains Voicu Oprean, Founder and CEO. “For our product business, acquisitions are primarily about achieving a larger footprint so that we can integrate customers onto our platform. For our services business, we look to gain both customers and staff to increase our delivery capacity.” While some M&A transactions deliver incremental gains, others are part of an overarching strategy to transform the company by adding a series of additional capabilities. Ivan Jakubek, Chief Strategy Officer of mobility services company EUROWAG says it scrutinised the core services used by truck drivers and transport business owners when designing its M&A strategy.",481
301,"“We saw which services we had in house, which we could build or partner, and which we would have to buy. The transformation of our company, from a narrowly-focused fintech to a comprehensive mobility operation, was driven by addressing transport businesses pain points.”   Navigating today’s headwinds Over the past 18 months, many economies have faced historically high inflation and interest-rate hikes, which have impacted the availability and cost of finance. Uncertainty has led to a divergence between buyers and sellers when it comes to valuations. In addition, there has been a change in sentiment towards the tech sector by some investors, which has reset values (though niche assets have held up well). Given today’s market conditions and sentiment, if you are in the market for an acquisition, you need a clear picture of the target’s value. And regardless of competition for the asset, you should stick to your valuation. Ideally, you should communicate your valuation methodology early on so that both you and the target company arrive at a price that both recognise as fair.   Getting credit for deals When you do an M&A, and especially if you run a public company, it can be difficult to get credit from investors for the strategic benefits of an acquisition, and its contribution to P&L. Flemming Pedersen, CFO of the digital sports media group Better Collective – which has executed 32 acquisitions since it listed in 2018 (and has a dedicated M&A pipeline team that meets every two weeks) – says that communicating appropriate metrics to the market should be a priority. “We tell the market clearly what we are going to do and what the important KPIs are, and then frequently report these metrics,” he says. “Over time, this approach builds trust and confidence that M&A can lift performance.” In addition, you should clearly articulate how the M&A aligns with your company's long-term strategic goals and vision. Investors want to know how the acquisition fits into the bigger picture and how it contributes to your growth and profitability. One way to do this is by differentiating between organic and inorganic growth, so that investors can understand the benefits of each strategy. “In our case, while our competitors are swimming in their own line, we are effectively doing a decathlon,” says EUROWAG’s Jakubek.",466
302,"“We are not an M&A machine and we need to explain the story of each of our acquisitions and how they will contribute to overall future growth.”   Focus on culture for success While M&As sometimes fail because of insufficient due diligence, in most cases much of the success or failure of an acquisition comes down to integration. Without a well-thought-out integration strategy, you may struggle to realise synergies, leading to operational inefficiencies. Cohesion may also be difficult to achieve. At a simple level, IT issues associated with integrating platforms can be formidable, for instance. More fundamentally, workplace cultures and values, and management styles may be different, especially if an acquired company is in a different country. Conflicts can create disruptions, lower employee morale, and hinder integration. Simply overwriting the culture of an acquired company is not the answer: its dynamic may be important to its success. You need to consider the integration of each M&A on its own merits. Jakubek at EUROWAG says you should spend time getting to know the company, its founders and their culture. “We start talking to companies at least two years before an acquisition completes,” he says. “We want them to want to join us. The sellers should always be on your side.”   UP NEXTArticleHow tech firms can turbocharge transition to sustainable futureCommercial BankArticleFrom startup to scale up: lessons from entrepreneursCommercial BankSeriesEMEA digital leaders summit 2023Commercial BankLearn more about Commercial Bank at Citi or contact usTo help us put you in contact with the right person, please answer the following questions.* Are you an existing client with us?SelectRead Citigroup Privacy NoticesbacknextSubscribeSign up to receive our newsletter providing a roundup of recent content and updates on new reports.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",398
303,"global insights commercial bank how will lenders assess healthcare s covid 19 financial performance . How Will Lenders Assess Healthcare’s COVID-19 Financial Performance?OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle01 Jul 2021How Will Lenders Assess Healthcare’s COVID-19 Financial Performance?Commercial BankSharedownloadMore than a year after an unprecedented government-mandated shutdown of non-emergency treatment, many lenders are evaluating the financial performance of their clients as part of regular reviews or for M&A financing. How will they approach this task given the unique circumstances?The past 18 months have been turbulent for healthcare, with the first three of those months particularly challenging. From March to mid-May 2020, medical and dental offices were closed to patients for non-emergency treatment as a result of COVID-19. Most practices had no revenue and limited or diminished collections during this period. The shutdown was a catastrophic event for cash flow-based businesses, and significantly impacted their financial performance. Uncertainty about the length of the shutdown resulted in understandable anxiety for clients, managers, investors and lenders. As restrictions were lifted in May 2020 in some states, patients began receiving treatment and revenue began to flow once again. But for healthcare companies and their lenders, uncertainty continued. The collapse in earnings during the early part of the year left a void in companies’ annual figures, creating considerable challenges for healthcare companies. Those with plans to grow organically or through acquisition, or put themselves up for sale face particular problems. Moreover, the impact continued for much of the remainder of 2020, as practices (and banks) worried about further shutdowns. There were also concerns about whether patients would delay treatment or simply skip it altogether. At the same time, some healthcare businesses, notably urgent care and emergency medicine, enjoyed an increase in activity as a result of the pandemic. Nevertheless, these businesses also faced uncertainty — around how long COVID-19 testing (and subsequent vaccine) revenue could be sustained, and what implications this would have for their financial performance over the medium term. It remains unclear whether such firms will return to more regular patterns of financial performance or if the continued prevalence of the virus could create a “new normal.” Lenders’ key questions Lenders have taken a pragmatic view of the events of the past year. They have chosen to differentiate between the shutdown period and the subsequent re-opening. When evaluating financial performance, most lenders have focused on the following key questions: 1.",499
304,"Will the business return to being a viable concern (i.e., will patient activity resume at the same level as in the past)? 2. How quickly will the company return to its pre-COVID-19 performance? 3. Does the company have sufficient liquidity to cover its expenses during the recovery? To answer these questions, lenders are deploying numerous strategies to attempt to normalize their assessment of healthcare companies. Their chief objective is to understand, through analytics, the potential impact of the disruption in 2020 on short-, medium- and long-term trends and consider the financial implications for healthcare businesses. The principal ways that they assess these impacts include: • Trailing 12 months: As it is more than 12 months since the initial shutdown, this trend analysis tool is the one most commonly used by banks to assess post-COVID-19 performance. Most practices re-opened in May 2020, so May 2021 collections will facilitate a full 12-month analysis. The hope is that monthly collections (and production) over this period meet (or are close to) 2019 levels. In a high proportion of cases, this has proved to be the case. • Trailing six months: In some cases, there was a delayed opening of practices (some as late as September 2020) as a result of illness, employees’ reluctance to return to work and staffing problems relating to generous unemployment benefits. In such cases, banks are taking a flexible approach and performing trend analysis from when the practice re-opened. • Last quarter annualized: This evaluates performance on a one quarter basis, and multiplies it by four in order to annualize it. While this method may be less reliable than other longer term methods, it can be a helpful proxy for how a company is integrating or performing over a short period of time (for example, under new ownership or management) and may be used when considering M&A opportunities. This measure should be used with discretion and considered alongside sellers’ historical financials. • Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization & COVID Adjustment: While not a GAAP-recognized accounting statement, lenders are adjusting clients’ financials to take into account COVID-19 in an attempt to normalize EBITDA. There are a number of methods to achieve this objective.",469
305,"For instance, the performance of March, April and May 2020 can be replaced with the same period in 2019 to help banks assess the year as a whole. In other cases, more sophisticated adjustments relating to the shutdown have been used (and accepted by banks). The goal of this trend analysis is to assess future capacity to cover expenses. Information is critical To perform all of the above analyses satisfactorily, it is important to consider the following: • Without high quality internal and/or CPA prepared financials, the above analyses cannot be executed. If healthcare firms cannot produce high quality month-over-month financials, trend analysis is impossible. In such circumstances, banks are likely to be less flexible and potentially unwilling to support a company’s current and future needs. • The pandemic has put the spotlight on high quality forecasting to a greater extent than in the past. Companies should develop projections to share with their banks and be able to articulate the direction of the business in order to facilitate discussions about credit. • Having a clear understanding of operating costs, particularly around administrative or non-clinical staffing, has become more important. Finding staff, particularly for administrative roles, is expected to continue to be challenging. Being able to understand whether the company has adequate staffing to serve its current patient base and scale is also important. • Adjustments and analysis can go both ways. In some parts of the healthcare industry, such as urgent care or emergency medicine (and especially among companies that perform testing and administer vaccines), COVID-19 had a hugely positive impact on company financials. This has resulted in a temporary spike in collections, which may not be sustained. Similarly, in some cases operating expenses fell sharply during the shutdown due to fewer employees on payroll, rent abatements and other allowances: this could create a falsely inflated EBITDA margin. Furthermore, many companies have benefited from Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding, Paycheck Protection Program loans, Department of Health and Human Services grants, and advances from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which have potentially increased EBITDA. • No trend analysis methods are perfect and they are not the only tool banks use; they help provide certain data points that lenders use to establish evaluate a company’s strategy and outlook. Strong management remains one of the most important factors considered by lenders when making decisions. • Communication is critical.",479

310,"global insights commercial bank it s time to simplify bank relationships and accounts. It’s time to simplify bank relationships and accountsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle25 Jan 2023It’s time to simplify bank relationships and accountsCommercial BankShare             Consolidating bank relationships and accounts is always good practice. But as interest rates have shifted upwards and the macroeconomic outlook has become less certain, many companies are looking for fixes to increase visibility and control, cut operating costs and try to find potentially higher investment returns on surplus funds. Rationalizing bank account structures does all this – and more.   What’s the Main Issue? Many mid-sized firms have grown rapidly, either through acquisition or organically. As a result, they often have dozens of bank relationships and accounts around the world. Managing multiple bank accounts and relationships is complex, time-consuming and can be costly. Each bank has their own online banking tools with different functionality; treasury staff need to be trained on multiple systems and monitor liquidity across several banks and accounts every day. What’s more, each account, even if dormant, may incur a fee.   Three Steps to Optimization Changing economic and market conditions mean it is the perfect time for companies to take stock of their bank arrangements with a view to improving efficiency, control and visibility. Normally companies address their banking structures in a series of phases (although it is also possible to take a ‘big bang’ approach).1.	Account RationalizationWork through your account list to identify and eliminate duplicate accounts for the same entity or other accounts that are no longer required, such as those that were set up for a specific transaction or client relationship. Your bank can help you understand specific account functions — a seemingly superfluous account may be necessary to access local clearing for payroll, for example.2.	Bank ConsolidationConsolidating all activity to a primary bank can maximize visibility and control. It can also improve risk management by centralizing information about who has access and accountability for each account and make reporting more straightforward. But you need to consider all aspects of a bank relationship. Maintaining some additional bank relationships can provide access to multiple sources of credit.",436
311,"Equally, not all banks are in all markets, so it’s important to think about product range and footprint when making decisions.3.	Optimize CashOnce you have gained visibility of funds — either by reducing the number of portals you use or consolidating activity (including third-party banks) to a single screen — you can make better use of liquidity. You may be able to offset debits and credits between different entities or jurisdictions within the organization (avoiding overdraft costs) and fund them more efficiently. “You can put automated sweeps in place on a regional or global basis using zero balance account structures (typically after companies have sought independent tax advice). Sweeps can take place either at end-of-day or intraday, depending on the company’s liquidity needs, and can include third-party banks. They can even convert funds to a company’s functional currency using notional FX currency conversion, lowering costs. After credits and debits are offset, any surplus liquidity could also be invested centrally in money market funds – which now offer significantly higher rates than a year ago – to maximize returns, or to offset bank fees through earnings credits.Choosing the Right Bank Citi has a global network covering nearly 100 countries and direct membership of around 400 clearing systems.  This coverage helps you to potentially gain access to later cutoff times, a wider range of payment types, and achieve new efficiencies.  Some banks that may depend on correspondent banking relationships to provide such coverage may find it hard to offer this with the same efficiencies. Citi can provide access to liquidity on a country, regional and global basis, and its product range and advanced technology offer opportunities for further efficiencies and savings, by improving FX management for example.         Learn more about Commercial Bank at Citi or contact usTo help us put you in contact with the right person, please answer the following questions.* Are you an existing client with us?SelectRead Citigroup Privacy NoticesbacknextSubscribeSign up to receive our newsletter providing a roundup of recent content and updates on new reports.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",451

315,"global insights commercial bank market insights emerging markets have fx crises been postponed or prevented . Market Insights: Emerging Markets — Have FX Crises Been Postponed or Prevented?OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Business & Professional Services CompaniesArticle01 Jul 2021Market Insights: Emerging Markets — Have FX Crises Been Postponed or Prevented?Commercial BankSharedownloadOne notable characteristic of FX markets over the last year has been a limited number of currency crises — far fewer than had been predicted given the economic catastrophe triggered by the pandemic. Why has this happened? And what might change the outlook?The normal progression of a currency crisis is that an unforeseen event triggers a sudden stop to capital inflows. Because financial markets react faster than economies — or at least that is the theory — exchange rates depreciate much more initially than would be implied by underlying fundamentals. That is, they overshoot and are typically on the rebound (in real terms) before the economic cycle hits its trough. The first part of this sequence played out as expected in March 2020 when the OPEC+ meeting (the 14 members of OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC members) failed to agree on production cuts necessitated by the emerging pandemic. But two factors quickly changed the situation. Firstly, the Fed called a halt to the dollar’s advance within just a few weeks. This would very rarely happen in the event of an individual-country currency crisis (the Mexican peso crisis of 1995 is an exception). However, in this instance it was deemed necessary given the global nature of the crisis. Secondly, the downturn in economic activity was much faster and deeper than in previous recessions because of containment measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. The coordinated downturn in activity then prompted a dramatic improvement in the current account balances of many countries, meaning that they were no longer nearly as susceptible to a sudden halt of capital flows. Consider the five emerging markets illustrated in figure 1, which were dubbed the “fragile five” in 2013 due to concerns about their current account deficits in the wake of the “taper tantrum”.",438
316,"The latest data shows Brazil’s current account deficit at its lowest level in 13 years while its central bank has forecast a surplus this year; South Africa has posted its first surplus since 2002 and the largest year-toyear improvement since 1985; India has a surplus for the first time since 2003; and the reduction in Indonesia’s deficit represents the largest shift since the East Asian crisis of 1998. There is one exception: Turkey’s deficit has risen to 5.1% of GDP in 2020, just over the 5% level normally seen as critical. Turkey’s balance of payments deterioration is just one facet of a broader crisis for the country, however. The relief provided by the Fed, and the consequent improvements in the balance of payments for the “fragile five”, are inherently short term in nature. The pandemic may be winding down in some countries, but many are still facing record numbers of infections and deaths as well as new non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs — the term now used to cover the wide variety of containment measures adopted by governments). Debt burdens, whether internal or external, have risen sharply to levels previously considered unsustainable, and the interest rate pendulum has started to reverse. Almost all countries have called a halt to the interest-rate cutting cycle, and Brazil, Russia and some other countries have started to raise rates. Does this mean that the currency crises expected last year have merely been postponed rather than prevented? Another “taper tantrum” The evidence so far is encouraging in terms of the ability of the “fragile five” and other emerging market countries to withstand the impact of higher US rates. Local currency-denominated bond yields have increased for a broad array of emerging markets, with a number of central banks taking steps to try to moderate or prevent any increases. Some bond auctions have failed as central banks have been unwilling to accept higher yields, but, as illustrated in figure 2, the overall increase in yields this year has been quite moderate. For more than half the countries in the sample, the increase in 10-year yields has been less than in the US 10-year yield. Obviously, there are a number of countries with higher bond yields, which have either defaulted, or which face major financing problems (e.g., Argentina and Ecuador), but these countries had problems well before US yields started to increase. Overall, this is not an environment that would trigger destabilizing exchange-rate moves.",495
317,"Of course, higher interest rates are only one component of the current environment. As noted earlier, debt burdens have risen to levels previously considered unsustainable. The IMF, in its semiannual World Economic Outlook released in April, 2021 estimated that government debt as a percent of GDP rose in 168 out of 187 markets between 2019 and 2020, the inevitable result of increased government spending, reduced taxation, and the slump in economic activity. Whether debt is a significant burden today depends on whether it was a significant burden previously. In the case of Brazil, the debt ratio has long been a matter of concern. The same is true for South Africa, with a debt burden projected to increase this year to more than 80% of GDP. Even where countries have lower deficits — e.g., Colombia at 62.8% in 2020 — their debt burden may be viewed as potentially problematic by the main ratings agencies given longstanding concerns. What do we need to watch? To date, emerging markets — and emerging market currencies — have weathered the increase in US bond yields and the increase in government debt better than expected. However, the outlook will depend on the path of the pandemic: how fast can vaccines be deployed, to what extent new waves of infections develop, whether variants of concern are resistant to existing vaccines, how long will existing vaccines be effective, and how policymakers respond. In those countries now facing new waves of infections and deaths, such as Brazil, pressure is building for a further relaxation of fiscal policy in order to cope with the dislocation of economic activity. The IMF’s April 2021 World Economic Outlook further revised upward its forecast for global economic growth following an upgrade in January. But some countries are now being obliged to lower their 2021 GDP growth forecasts and push back the likely timetable for an easing of NPIs. The return to normal in terms of budget deficits and debt burdens will similarly need to be extended, thereby increasing the risk of exposure to higher global interest rates and a taper tantrum.",409

Metaverse and Money: Decrypting the FutureOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle15 Jul 2022Metaverse and Money: Decrypting the FutureCommercial BankContributor(s):  Citi GPSShareDOWNLOADThe Metaverse as a concept has been around for a few decades. However, interest in the virtual world spiked at the end of 2021 following a rise in sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as well as announcements from Big Tech players indicating their interest and investment in the space.Today, the most popular way to experience the Metaverse is via a video game played on a virtual reality (VR) headset. But in the report that follows, we discuss the possibility that the Metaverse is moving towards becoming the next iteration of the internet, or Web3. This “Open Metaverse” would be community-owned, community-governed, and a freely interoperable version that ensures privacy by design.Users should increasingly be able to access a host of use cases, including commerce, art, media, advertising, healthcare, and social collaboration. A device-agnostic Metaverse would be accessible via personal computers, game consoles, and smartphones, resulting in a large ecosystem. Using this broad definition, the total addressable market for the Metaverse could be between $8 trillion and $13 trillion by 2030, with total Metaverse users numbering around five billion.But getting to that market level is going to require infrastructure investment. The content streaming environment of the Metaverse will likely require a computational efficiency improvement of over 1,000x today’s levels. Investment will be needed in areas such as compute, storage, network infrastructure, consumer hardware, and game development platforms.The definition of what counts as money in the Open Metaverse is also likely to be very different from what counts as money in the real world today. Interoperability and seamless exchange between underlying blockchain technology are critical to ensure a frictionless user experience. Different forms of cryptocurrency are expected to dominate, but given the multi-chain trend in the crypto ecosystem, cryptocurrency will likely coexist with fiat currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and stablecoins.Finally, if the Metaverse is indeed the new iteration of the internet, it will mostly likely attract greater scrutiny from global regulators, policymakers, and governments.",484
325,"Issues such as anti-money laundering rules for exchanges and wallets, the use of decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto assets, and property rights will all have to be addressed.The Metaverse Is Potentially an $8 Trillion to $13 Trillion Opportunity We believe the Metaverse may be the next generation of the internet — combining the physical and digital world in a persistent and immersive manner — and not purely a Virtual Reality world. A device-agnostic Metaverse accessible via PCs, game consoles, and smartphones could results in a very large ecosystem. Based on our definition, we estimate the total addressable market for the Metaverse economy could grow to between $8 trillion and $13 trillion by 2030.Metaverse Use Cases Gaming is viewed as a key Metaverse use case for the next several years due to the immersive and multi-player experience of the space currently But we believe that the Metaverse will eventually help us find new and enhanced ways to do all our current activities, including commerce, entertainment and media, education and training, manufacturing and enterprise in general. Enterprise use cases of the Metaverse in the coming years will likely include internal collaboration, client contact, sales and marketing, advertising, events and conference, engineering and design, and workforce training.Still Early: Metaverse Infrastructure Building In the current state, the internet infrastructure is unsuitable for building a full-immersive, content streaming Metaverse environment, that enables users to go seamlessly from one experience to another. To make the vision of Metaverse a reality, we expect significant investment in a confluence of technology.",314

331,"global insights commercial bank moving healthcare forward considerations as practices reopen. Moving Healthcare Forward: Considerations as Practices ReopenOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle01 Jun 2020Moving Healthcare Forward: Considerations as Practices ReopenCommercial BankShareDOWNLOADFor most healthcare providers, 2020 began on an optimistic note. With a strong economy, many practices were humming along – with full patient schedules and a booked out calendar – the industry was positioned for another year of growth. Then COVID-19 hit. The world as we knew it changed, possibly forever. Healthcare providers were mandated to cease elective procedures and, in many cases, close down offices altogether.Even as states lift shelter-in-place restrictions and healthcare providers are given the greenlight to start seeing patients again, healthcare practices face unprecedented headwinds. Chief among these are the financial uncertainties that lie ahead. So, what should providers be thinking about as they reopen? And how can they partner with their bank to align for success in such an uncertain environment? Once offices reopen, how can I get patient and cash flow back to normal levels? The first priority should be to assess business operations and focus on getting back to profitability. Many providers have reported busy schedules in the initial weeks of reopening due to pent up demand during the shutdown. Effectively managing patient scheduling and ensuring you have adequate staff and supplies to safely meet patient needs will be critical in these initial stages. There will be enhanced procedures and safety requirements to adhere to, which may increase costs. Patient engagement will also be vital. Providers that have embraced technology to stay in touch with patients while practices were closed are well positioned for growth. Companies that are only now contacting patients should assess whether any initial surge in volume can be sustained. Expect cash flow to remain tight in the early weeks as the revenue cycle catches up with patient flow. Forecasting key metrics and expenses will help to identify your cash needs. Such insights will be invaluable to understanding the pace of business recovery. As most healthcare providers are reimbursed through commercial insurers or the Center for Medicare and Medicaid, there is likely to be a 30-45 day lag between patient treatment and cash collection. It is therefore more important than ever to keep a heightened focus on revenue cycle management, compliance and process integrity to ensure that cash flow increases in lockstep with patient volume.",471
332,"What does it mean to my company if my loan covenants are violated? With companies required to cease operations for several weeks, there have been material changes to bottom-line performance. Covenant violations will be a likely side effect. Consequently, communication with your banking partner should be a priority to ensure all parties work through these events together. Your banking partner wants to hear from you in both good times and bad; it is important to share information even if the outlook is challenging or uncertain. You will need to be able to demonstrate you understand the operational challenges you face and articulate a strategy to return your business back to plan. Review the terms in your loan agreement, understand how the covenants are calculated and the recourse if violations occur. Consult with a trusted advisor such as your attorney, CPA or your lender. You may be asked to provide additional financial reporting and a 13-week cash flow forecast. Use this as an opportunity to assess your operations and reinforce your credibility with your banker. If you do so, when you are ready to shift focus back to growing your business, you will be well positioned to take on additional capital. Banks have generally shown a willingness to support covenant waivers and if needed, payment deferments. Be patient with the process and know that your banker will want to see your company return to normal and recover successfully as much as you do. Should I be making acquisitions now? Is this going to impact multiples? The decision to expand your practice is now more complex as a result of COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 in the states where you operate will likely determine the impact on your office’s finances. This financial impact could dictate whether you can entertain new acquisitions. While public market transaction valuations are down roughly 20% since the COVID-19 restrictions began, healthcare providers appear to have retained their value so far, with minimal changes to transaction multiples. Some structural enhancements should be considered for near-term acquisitions such as earn-outs or deferred payment compensation to ensure interests are aligned and these companies are able to resume normalized operations. If you were evaluating acquisitions prior to COVID-19 and are experiencing a meaningful reduction in cash flow and/or repayment capacity, aim to demonstrate sustainability of stabilized operations for a period of one or two quarters before taking on additional indebtedness for transactions. Communication with your banker will be important to reestablish access to capital.",471
333,"When will banks be willing to lend again? How much liquidity will be available during the remainder of 2020? While the 2008 recession was caused by a structural disruption in the financial markets, the recent downturn was started by a public health crisis; this is not a financial crisis. As such, banks remain well capitalized and are financially stronger than in the last recession. Banks have sufficient liquidity to lend but they want to ensure they are lending to practices best positioned to succeed in the aftermath of several weeks of distribution or outright closure. Although healthcare is a resilient industry, providers that have struggled with patient and staff engagement and do not have appropriate operational control may experience a protracted recovery relative to those that have embraced the recent challenges. You should be prepared to discuss these issues with your banking partner in order to secure capital to support your growth strategy. The healthcare industry has been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and will take time to recover. Moreover, the road to recovery will vary, depending on your specialty and location. However, no healthcare provider has to navigate the postshutdown world alone. You need to work with your closest advisors and gain the benefit of their insight, guidance and counsel. Your accountant, attorney, banker and industry cohorts can act as a sounding board when you are developing and executing on your plan. With most shelter-in-place orders being lifted and healthcare practices re-opening, these relationships will help position your company to weather the storm and succeed amidst the COVID-19 landscape.   Learn more about Commercial Bank at Citi or contact usTo help us put you in contact with the right person, please answer the following questions.* Are you an existing client with us?SelectRead Citigroup Privacy NoticesbacknextSubscribeSign up to receive our newsletter providing a roundup of recent content and updates on new reports.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",403
334,"global insights commercial bank navigating an uncertain economic environment. Navigating economic uncertainty: how banks can help charities improve donation efficiency OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for NonprofitsArticle29 Jun 2023Navigating economic uncertainty: how banks can help charities improve donation efficiency Commercial BankShareDOWNLOADCONTACT US Nonprofits are increasingly concerned that the uncertain economic environment  in many countries now and in the near future, will impact their fundraising efforts. The threat of recession or economic uncertainty at any time in general could spell trouble for nonprofits. Consumers may already be reducing their charitable donations in light of the macroeconomic backdrop as mentioned in our recent report1. If people fear they might lose their job, their spending habits – including donations – will change. Charities are already reporting higher levels of demand1. Nonprofits could face a squeeze on their revenues just as their work becomes more important than ever. Many nonprofits are going to have to double down on revenue generation and efforts to optimize efficiency if they are going to be able to meet growing demand for their support. How nonprofits can respond While the outlook for nonprofits certainly appears difficult, their experience of overcoming unprecedented challenges during COVID-19 should stand them in good stead. This dynamism will be essential in any forthcoming economic downturn. While recurring donations remain critical, nonprofits must also make donating as convenient and simple as possible as people increasingly make quick decisions to donate because of content they have read or viewed online. Nonprofits need to leverage such opportunities with simple donation tools that minimize the amount of financial and other information consumers must input and – ideally – require them to impart no information at all. Many nonprofits made significant efforts to streamline their processes and drive efficiencies in order to lower costs during the pandemic. But additional opportunities remain. Streamlining and improving collection efficiency Citi offers a number of solutions that give nonprofits an efficient and secure way to receive donations, helping to lower costs and improve donor confidence. Available in the US, Citi Present and Pay is an omni-channel electronic bill presentment and payment platform that enables clients to collect from donors in a wide variety of ways. Nonprofits can receive one-time electronic payments via ACH and credit card, online, on the phone or via smartphone. Crucially, the payment page on Present and Pay is branded with the organization’s logo and other details and can be linked directly from the organization’s front-end website or mobile site, making donations straightforward.",491
335,"Nonprofits can also embed the platform’s capabilities into its existing website or mobile app using a series of APIs. Importantly, the solution can be deployed quickly once an organization has completed the necessary documentation. A differentiated solution “Spring by CitiSM” provides nonprofit clients with a single solution to accept donations online via card, alternative payment methods, such as digital wallets, and bank transfers such as instant payments and subscription-ready ACH direct debits. The solution enables a seamless payment acceptance experience whether on a browser, smartphone or within an app, helping to ensure you’re maximizing your donation collections. It can also fully integrate into clients’ back-end systems to facilitate automated reconciliation, streamlined processes and granular reporting. Spring by Citi provides nonprofit clients with a safe, secure and seamless way to collect donations. For nonprofits collecting from overseas, Spring by Citi can offer embedded FX to mitigate currency risk. Citi offers Spring by Citi in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore and the UK. It will launch in the US for CCB clients shortly and in four other countries following in the near future. In Conclusion The coming months will no doubt be challenging for many nonprofits in the US and around the world as the economic outlook remains challenging for nonprofits. But by communicating effectively with their donor base, innovating their campaigning efforts and focusing on demonstrating their ability to deliver results, nonprofits can continue to thrive. A key part of these efforts must be initiatives to concentrate resources on frontline activity, lower administration costs and improve visibility and control across the organization. Finding more convenient and effective ways to collect donations is also critical. Regardless of whether the threat of recession becomes a reality, nonprofits should look to their banks for insights and support in helping them achieve their strategic goals.

338,"global insights commercial bank nonprofits and erp systems. Nonprofits and ERP systems:OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for NonprofitsArticle14 Nov 2023Nonprofits and ERP systems:What, when, why and how?Commercial BankShareDOWNLOADNonprofit organizations keep a close eye on costs to ensure that their funding helps to achieve their social, environmental or other objectives. But once nonprofits reach a certain size, managing collections and spending is challenging; manual processes and spreadsheets become inefficient and costly, and could create potential risks. At this point, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could be the answer. Widely used throughout the nonprofit and corporate world, an ERP system is a software solution that connects functions across the organization, including finance, accounts payables and receivables, sales, procurement, and human resources; it can streamline and automate many tasks. An ERP can be connected to your bank via host-to-host and/or direct integration, facilitating the two-way exchange of data, so you can receive bank statements and send payment files securely. Ultimately, using an ERP system can improve donor visibility  by allowing you to track information and donation history (and tag donors for follow-up campaigns). It can also enhance transparency, which can build donor trust and confidence. Moreover, ERP systems are scalable, ensuring the organization does not have to implement multiple successive systems as you grow and your needs evolve. Benefits of an ERP system Implementing an ERP system, and integrating it with your bank, can deliver the following benefits: Increased operational efficiency: You can see account balances and transactions within the system so there is no need to login to multiple bank portals. Time spent on manual spreadsheet data entry can be reallocated to other tasks, such as fundraising and program delivery (or staff costs can be reduced). An ERP also provides an opportunity to rationalize bank accounts and relationships, review and streamline processes, and centralize treasury functions. Enhanced working capital: With improved visibility of your inflows and outflows, you can ensure you have enough cash on hand for day-to-day activities. Improved risk management: Improved visibility of cash, FX and other positions allows nonprofits to standardize processes and enhance risk management as two-way data flows between an ERP system and the bank are securely encrypted. Better informed decision-making: Real-time data can be used to track the performance of different programs, identify areas for cost reduction, and help make strategic decisions about the future of the organization.",499
339,"An ERP system also integrates various departments and functions across a nonprofit, creating the potential to improve  communication and teamwork. Integrating with your bank Nonprofits typically connect their ERP system to their banks using host-to-host connectivity, which takes between four and six weeks. There are two encryption options: Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP): Both parties exchange encryption keys, which then perform a digital handshake to establish secure channels to send and receive data. This option is used by the vast majority of nonprofits. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): In addition to the SFTP encryption described above, PGP adds file level encryption. Working with the right partner An ERP is a big investment and choosing a system can seem daunting. Your system must provide all the functionality required by your organization while aligning with your budget and IT and training resources. While a customized solution can be more expensive, you may need to accommodate online, cash or check donations; you might also have international bank accounts to integrate, or require the ability to make FX payments overseas. You must also decide whether to implement a cloud or an on-premises ERP (the former is usually more cost effective, billed via a subscription and requires fewer IT resources for implementation and maintenance). Fortunately, your bank can help you navigate your ERP journey, working with your external IT partner to ensure you choose an  ERP and streamline your set-up, even if you have limited internal resources. By working with the right bank, your ERP system can start delivering benefits shortly thereafter. Citi Commercial Bank has a dedicated Nonprofit team covering both treasury and relationship management. Our bankers have deep industry expertise and understand your challenges and ambitions: we have integrated with almost every type of ERP system for every type of client . Our experienced technical team and ERP integration technology helps to ensure that the process proceeds smoothly, on time and on budget.

343,"global insights commercial bank revenue cycle management an important opportunity for healthcare. Revenue Cycle Management: An Important Opportunity for HealthcareOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle01 Jul 2020Revenue Cycle Management: An Important Opportunity for HealthcareCommercial BankShareDOWNLOADThe healthcare sector is undergoing a profound transformation, as small practices consolidate into larger multi-location businesses, and external investors, such as private equity, increase their involvement. For healthcare businesses, growth can improve professionalism, efficiency and patient care. However, consolidation and growth also shine a spotlight on inefficiencies in the sector. Most notably, there are significant gains to be made in relation to revenue cycle management (RCM).RCM is, in theory, a straightforward process that brings together the business and clinical sides of healthcare. It includes a range of tasks, including charge capture, claim submission, coding diagnoses and procedures, and collecting payments. However, in practice, the almost infinite number of variations available in the US health sector in terms of payers and processes means that RCM at many healthcare providers is sub-optimal. Historically, medical services – and dental services in particular – have been extremely fragmented and small scale. That means that investment in technology has often been seen as prohibitively expensive and largely unnecessary. It has been easy to overlook inefficient RCM practices given the local, low-volume nature of activity. As a result, processes associated with billing and reimbursement have, in many cases, remained largely unchanged for decades. What’s driving change? The accelerating pace of consolidation of offices into Medical Service Organizations (MSOs) and Dental Service Organizations (DSOs) is prompting a reconsideration of inefficient legacy processes. For instance, one dental group that works with Citi recently acquired multiple practices that deal primarily with cash, submit paper reimbursements to insurers or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) via mail, and receive consolidated paper checks on a 45 to 60-day timeline. Processes involving paper-based documents and cash or check-based collections increase the amount of time between providing a service and receiving payment, which increases working capital requirements and potentially acts as a drag on profitability. Perhaps most importantly, manual-based processes are time consuming and prone to errors: for small practices in particular, billing, chasing up and reconciling receivables can take up large amounts of employees’ time. Consolidation of individual practices into larger, scalable platforms inevitably results in growing pains relating to such processes.",496
344,"One group that Citi works with had just five practices in 2019 but will have 35 by the end of 2020: billing and reconciliation business-as-usual is simply not sustainable at that pace of growth. Often the rolling up of small practices into larger groups coincides with the appointment of executive management (such as a CFO), who may come from business sectors where treasury practices are more sophisticated. This can elevate the importance of receivables management. Equally, the involvement of private equity investors in MSOs and DSOs can increase the focus on transparency of costs. Both factors can lead to higher levels of investment and a newfound emphasis on automation of processes to improve efficiency. An additional recent driver that has emerged in the COVID-19 environment is the pressure on healthcare providers’ revenues. The industry currently has an enormous backlog, following a two-and-a-half-month shutdown, during which only emergency patients were seen. Consequently, revenue has fallen to almost nothing. Now that businesses are reopening, billing of payers has begun to resume. But there will be a gap of 45 to 60 days before collections are due. Initiatives to accelerate those receivables are therefore a priority. Equally, many companies have sought to take advantage of market conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic to raise debt and equity capital in order to make acquisitions. As part of a plan to enhance their liquidity base and better position themselves for M&A activity, some companies are giving a higher priority to receivables in order to accelerate cash flow. Recognizing the challenge Treasury products have a large part to play in expediting receivables for healthcare companies. But before MSOs and DSOs start to consider the various solutions available, it is important to get the basics right. Most obviously, healthcare companies need to recognize that they face a challenge in managing their receivables. This can be trickier than it sounds. Often people managing receivables just assume that the problems they face are intractable because it is not their core day-to-day function. In other situations, employees responsible for managing receivables may be reluctant to make changes to ingrained work practices for fear of losing status (or even their job). So how do companies know if there is a problem? The biggest sign is that the business faces cash constraints on a periodic basis. Many healthcare firms run a boom-and-bust revenue roller coaster without realizing that RCM can smooth it out.",495
345,"Often the arrival of an outsider (usually with finance expertise) acts as a wake-up call. A CFO at one Citi client recalls the challenge that greeted his arrival: he had to reconcile 25 office locations that paid into a single account, with no idea of where the money had come from. Recognizing there is a problem does not mean that healthcare companies have to transform their operations overnight. Indeed, treasury products and structures can go a long way to increasing treasury sophistication without requiring large-scale investment in training or technology. MSOs and DSOs should also make use of the expertise and thought leadership of their banks, which are familiar with common RCM strategies and best practice in the healthcare sector. Finding the right solution There is a wide range of options available to healthcare companies seeking to improve their RCM. One possibility may be to outsource billing and remittance processing to a specialist provider with experience of high-volume CMS billing. However, this option can be costly and many providers prefer to centralize their billing in-house. For those that do, efficiencies can come from myriad different technological solutions. On the operational side, electronic bill presentment and payment software, such as Citi Present & Pay, can do much to streamline processes and reduce paperwork. Some companies may find they have a large number of re-billings (whether to commercial or government payers) due to payment declines resulting from incorrect case codes, for example. Re-billing effectively doubles administrative costs. The introduction of relatively inexpensive medical billing software can not only reduce such costs, but also lay the foundations for further automation. Automation of collections is often the next step undertaken by MSOs and DSOs to improve their RCM. Companies that currently collect reimbursement checks should quantify the costs associated with this process as well as the implications in terms of days receivables and average cash in hand. Most Medicare and Medicaid payments can now be received electronically – these payment methods are typically seven days faster than a mailed check and are straightforward to implement. There are still some Medicare and Medicaid payments at the state level that are reimbursed via check. Technology can improve efficiency even in these situations, with Remote Check Deposit capabilities that allow for seamless check depositing from multiple locations. Reconciliation is a common pain point for healthcare companies. Many find it challenging to post Electronic Data Interchange information, especially when it relates to multiple payers.",477
346,"In some cases, a payer might send a single ACH payment for 500 patients, which takes time and effort to break out and reconcile. Citi® Smart Match uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to read remittance notices received by a company (either in paper form or electronically), extract various useful pieces of data and implement a single process for all receivables. The use of AI and ML means that the system learns where a payment is coming from and how to handle it. Receivables are automatically matched to received payments, making cash application significantly more efficient and focusing the attention of account receivables employees on exceptions management. Automating manually intensive processes reduces costs and saves time. At the same time, faster reconciliation lowers days sales outstanding and optimizes working capital. Building a sound structure As well as technological solutions, banking structures can play an important role in RCM. Companies first need to ensure that their bank account arrangements are fit for purpose. Some groups that have grown by acquisition may have dozens of legacy accounts, incurring unnecessary fees and increasing complexity; where possible, these should be consolidated. All companies should also check to ensure that CMS and private funds are properly segregated within their account structures. Once this groundwork has been done, MSOs and DSOs should work with their banks to investigate options such as zero balance accounts (ZBAs) and sweeps that move funds between the management company and clinical enterprises on an automated basis. Such structures ensure that liquidity gets to where it can be used most effectively, as quickly as possible. In a typical structure, individual accounts are set up for each practice. These then feed into a parent account that serves as a source of funding for business spending and payroll. As well as increasing the availability of liquidity, ZBA and sweep structures facilitate easy segregation of funds for individual offices. This can be important in groups where offices are independently licensed and credentialed with payers. In such situations, billing must remain at sub-entity level (with funds received in the same account). However, funds can be automatically rolled up to the parent account. Segmented account structures can go a long way toward making reconciliation easier, in addition to the technological solutions available to automate reconciliation. Conclusion The healthcare sector is changing rapidly and the pace of change could accelerate further in the wake of COVID-19, which could prompt opportunistic M&A activity.",482

351,"global insights commercial bank starting early on esg and sustainability strategies. Starting early on ESG and sustainability strategies can support growth long-term for privately held companiesOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Consumer & Retail CompaniesArticle12 Oct 2023Starting early on ESG and sustainability strategies can support growth long-term for privately held companiesCommercial BankShareDOWNLOADThe risks and opportunities surrounding sustainability and environmental, social and governance matters, or “ESG,” are increasingly becoming part of every company’s journey. Regulation, customer preferences, societal shifts, and net zero commitments by many governments, corporations, and financial institutions, are changing the business landscape for many companies, including privately held companies. Currently, we are seeing more and more companies establish net zero commitments and taking steps to promote diversity and inclusivity across their workforce. In turn, this is incentivizing privately held companies to integrate ESG and sustainability into decision making earlier and earlier in their growth trajectory. In this brief note, we highlight the importance of integrating ESG issues into a company’s strategy and discuss the opportunities that can arise from having a coherent ESG strategy as part of a company’s growth journey. The Rise of ESG What started as a trend in ESG and sustainability-linked capital markets is now expanding into other financial services, allowing companies to incorporate ESG considerations throughout their treasury management, capital raising, trade finance and deposits. There has been a sharp increase in capital being raised with sustainable financial instruments. There has been an extraordinary growth in the issuance of green bonds, social, sustainability bonds and sustainability-linked bonds as shown in the diagram on page 2. Sustainability-linked loans and revolving credit facilities, where interest rates can change depending on achievements in sustainability targets, are also becoming well-established, and Sustainable Supply Chain Finance is a growing opportunity for companies. We are also seeing a growing number of companies making net zero commitments and developing transition strategies, which will have impacts across their value chains. Some companies also find it useful to join the Science Based Targets initiative, which is an organization that works with companies to define and promote best practice in emission reductions and net zero targets in line with climate science. As of September 2023, over 6000 companies have either committed to net zero or set science-based targets to reduce their emissions through this initiative*. Many financial institutions, including Citi, have also committed to net zero which will lead to reductions in financed emissions across their lending portfolios over time.",496
352,"This means lenders will seek more detailed ESG and climate disclosures about emissions and business strategies over time from their borrowing clients and their clients’ value chain.   New regulations can also create increased demands for companies to calculate and disclose ESG metrics. Much regulation has impacted primarily larger or publicly listed companies. For example, the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive (CSRD) in the EU will make businesses more accountable by obliging them to disclose both how sustainability issues affect their performance and their own impacts on people and planet. This directive applies to European companies with any two of the following: over 250 employees, 40 million Euros in turnover and a balance sheet of over 20 million Euros. The directive may also apply to certain parent companies of non EU groups that include a European subsidiary or branch or that are listed in the EU. Another example is the proposed rule by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) called ‘The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors’. While a final rule is expected to be announced later in 2023, the proposal currently has a clause that would ask firms to make climate related disclosures at the time of an initial public offering. These regulations can also affect private companies indirectly who are embedded in the ecosystem as suppliers to public listed companies that will need to provide climate-related disclosures.   It is not only the ‘E’ in ESG that is growing, we are also seeing the dramatic ‘Rise of S’, which captures everything from gender diversity to poverty and hunger, with focus not only on a company’s own operations, but also throughout its supply chains. This is a huge opportunity for mid-sized companies to show how their activities impact not only the planet but also people.   The ESG landscape mid sized companies are navigating is becoming increasingly complex, with evolving disclosure frameworks in different jurisdictions, as well as escalating expectations from stakeholders.     The Opportunities of ESG At Citi, helping our clients navigate the challenges and embrace the opportunities of our rapidly changing world is fundamental to our mission of enabling growth and economic progress. This work is central to how we help our clients fortify themselves for the future. Opportunities that can arise from incorporating ESG into a company’s business strategy include: Improved access to capital – Simply by assessing ESG risks and making improvements – such as becoming more resource and water efficient and using less packaging – companies may be able to lower their cost base and develop more resilient business models.",490
353,"In addition, a well-conceived and communicated ESG strategy that improves strategic opportunities and reduces risk, can help make a company more attractive to ESG-focused investors thus potentially both improving access to capital and reducing the cost of that capital. Increased consumer engagement – The influence of consumers is growing, as they consider what to buy, why they buy it, and where they purchase their goods. Consumers are increasingly demanding to know and understand what ingredients are going into their food products as well as where their products are sourced from2. Understanding how important consumers view ESG is essential for B2C companies. Growth opportunities – A business which commits to become net zero usually will need to ensure that its supply chain and distribution network are also heading toward net zero. In essence, this means companies committed to net zero will often either work with their current suppliers to help them reduce their emissions (with potentially positive pricing/volume/trade finance terms to do so), or at the other extreme, those that will work with them3. A private company that supplies goods and services to these large companies will ultimately need to calculate and disclose their emissions and other ESG issues that are material, if they want to maintain these clients. Incorporating ESG issues early into business strategies also has an added advantage of potentially attracting new clients to their business as these clients look for sustainable suppliers. Attracting and retaining talent – Having a clear purpose, above and beyond maximizing profits, is increasingly an expectation of employees, especially millennials and Gen Z. Embracing ESG can be an important way to bring a significant sense of purpose to employees’ lives, helping to ensure companies can hire the best talent and retain them. ESG is expanding in its complexity, and whilst measuring and disclosing ESG issues might seem daunting at first, it can make business sense to do so. It should be seen as a fundamental part of running a successful business where returns are sustainable in the long-term. Guidance For companies, ESG is a process and a journey which can entail longer-term strategic targets, shorter-term milestones (and reporting on the same), on which they can take all stakeholders, from the providers of capital to customers, consumers, suppliers, and employees. Companies don’t have to do this alone. Citi Commercial Bank has the practical experience of helping clients implement many of the changes including how to embed ESG into an organization’s operational, financing and treasury strategies.",484

Steady solutions: how to navigate currency fluctuationsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Consumer & Retail CompaniesArticle10 Jul 2023Steady solutions: how to navigate currency fluctuationsGlobal manufacturers can deploy deep local knowledge and working capital to hedge against FX volatilityCommercial BankShare*This partner content was produced by the Financial Times on behalf of Citi Commercial Bank No successful company in history ever prospered without taking risks; juggling with potential jeopardy is a part of doing business. But lately, many leaders might agree that turbulent times are creating some of the thorniest challenges they’ve experienced to date. In a 2022 McKinsey report, executives responding to its annual Global Survey cited geopolitical conflict and inflation as the most pressing economic risks. Digging deeper into the data, supply chain challenges and currency fluctuation also loom large as ongoing concerns. Currency fluctuation is a particularly acute problem associated with inflation. Simply put, when inflation increases, the money in the economy will tend to depreciate relative to other currencies – this influences how competitive an affected company can be, and creates potentially expensive headaches when it comes to sending and receiving international payments. One brand that’s familiar with the vagaries of foreign exchange is Tramontina, a Brazilian cookware, cutlery and home appliances company with 10,000 employees, which manufactures 22,000 items and exports to more than 120 countries. Citi Commercial Bank is a global partner of Tramontina and supports the company across continents. “However, when you’re operating in regions like Latin America and Asia, currency fluctuations can be hard to predict. We can’t pass those costs onto customers whose prices we’ve locked in, so we may have to eat those losses for a while but clearly this is unsustainable” says Marcelo Borges, Tramontina’s US CEO Hedging to address volatility Businesses such as Tramontina often employ hedging strategies to protect against potential losses caused by adverse currency movements. These may include forward contracts, options and other financial instruments. A close monitoring of related influencing factors can also help anticipate forthcoming currency movements – looking at elements such as interest rate differentials, inflation rates, geopolitical events and government policies.  However, this level of oversight requires specialist attention and analysis and, crucially, deep knowledge of local markets.",490
355,"Borges points to Argentina as one country where currency changes can be challenging: “Only by working with an experienced bank, with a local presence and intimate understanding of the market, can we make the right decisions about product pricing and about buying the commodities to make those products” says Borges. Tramontina’s key banking relationship is with Citi Commercial Bank. Citi has operated internationally for over 200 years, and that has been helping Tramontina navigate in different markets, from Canada to India. Timicka Anderson, Global Head of Consumer & Retail at Citi Commercial Bank, explains that local currency fluctuations can be managed in several ways. “First, we can provide local currency financing – working capital, so they can make payments in the local currency, thus avoiding the additional costs that would come from using money from outside that country,” she says. “We also help with short-term hedging and can use a number of proprietary tools – such as our Citi Velocity digital content, data and analytics platform – to provide a detailed analysis of potential risks across a number of markets in different regions.” A global view for an interconnected analysis Anderson points out that, for manufacturing companies such as Tramontina, it’s not simply Citi’s role to advise on currency challenges, but to look at the interplay of other factors, too. As a company that buys a lot of aluminium, for example, Tramontina must hedge not just its currencies but also its commodities costs. “Our global presence helps us take a macro view across all markets,” says Anderson. “In Tramontina’s case, it could be how aluminium has historically performed against the dollar.”  As the US CEO of a company that’s been operating successfully for more than 100 years, Borges has some simple words of advice for those looking to expand internationally: “Play it safe.” He adds that Citi provides him with the sort of detailed local information that isn’t easy to access and which, together with the bank’s financial tools, allows Tramontina to make the most informed decisions possible – and mitigate risk. “We play it safe every day,” he smiles. “Perhaps we don’t grow as quickly as some other companies because of this, but we are in very good shape.” Global commerce is, by its nature, an uncertain affair.",474

Central Banks have been responding by raising interest rates in an effort to reduce inflationary pressures. This is leading to CEOs and CFOs across sectors and geographies adopting a series of strategic and financing measures based on careful forward planning, as well as flexibility and creativity.  These measures were highlighted in Citi Commercial Bank’s recent webinar ""High Inflation and rates: the new normal?”   The webinar discussion centered on the critical need for a global outlook and a diversified strategy to manage the impact of uncertainty. A recent Citi report emphasizes many of the themes that were discussed:  “The Storms Continue, But so Does Global Growth”   Strategies deployed by companies to deal with increasing inflation and rates   1 – Less is more...   When every extra penny counts, every dollar discounted makes a difference. Operational and financial optimization is key and efficiency is the way forward. In practical terms, this means adopting tactics including: •  Making your banking solutions digital to increase visibility, control, and efficiency so that you can free up human and capital resources to focus on what brings value to the business Consolidating and simplifying your banking operations Optimizing how you acquire and use credit, sourcing funds with the best rates available and making those funds available where they are most needed To quote Tasnim Ghiawadwala, Global Head of Citi’s Commercial Bank “As we partner with clients all over the world, we see companies increasingly focusing on cost optimization, on creating efficiencies and on yield, to face higher inflation and higher rates”. Tasnim emphasized that companies, regardless of sector, can learn from what peers in the Industrial, Consumer and Retail sectors, those hit especially hard by higher rates, have been doing to plan and execute the most appropriate strategies to mitigate against inflationary pressures. The session also brought insights from Latin America, a region that has been historically affected by high inflation.   2 – ...",476
357,"more also means more flexible   Timicka Anderson, Global Head of Consumer & Retail for Citi Commercial Bank, stressed that “Consumer and retail companies continue to understand the importance of flexibility in financing, operations, supply chain and human capital to navigate this environment”.   Timicka emphasized how recent global socioeconomic and geopolitical events have increasingly impacted businesses – from the COVID-19 pandemic to the conflict in Ukraine – and those that are doing well adapted quickly, using a wide range of financing tools: Adopting tools for managing supplier financing allowing for the extension of appropriate credit conditions along the supply chain Diversifying capital structures by including lower cost financing options Embracing new planning timelines, acknowledging that five-year strategies are now likely to be quickly outdated   3 – Opportunities may arise from challenges   It may sound like a cliché, but it is a fact that challenging times can also bring opportunities. ""This is especially true for larger, more sophisticated companies, with the access to the right financial tools and to the capital markets. These players may find that they are in the right position to consider inorganic growth by examining the potential to acquire smaller peers, who may be under pressure, and therefore diversify their operations or even expand their global presence”, explained André Cury, Head of Citi Commercial Bank for Latin America.   From this perspective, companies can look to: Explore opportunities in emerging markets Examine strategic mergers and / or acquisitions with better conditions for the buy-side Identify pressures arising from factors such as climate change and look at opportunities in the sustainability space; for example, by looking at financing linked to ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria Recalibrate planning to take advantage of movements such as nearshoring your supply chain, which bring to the table new markets and players   4 – How can Citi help your business?   “Please engage us in your strategy.

366,"global insights commercial bank supply chain disruption eight actions for mid cap companies . Supply chain disruption: eight actions for mid-sized companies OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Consumer & Retail CompaniesArticle02 Mar 2023Supply chain disruption: eight actions for mid-sized companies Commercial BankShare   Disruptions prompted by the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have created a shift in buyer/supplier relationships. Companies need to develop relationships with new buyers and suppliers as part of a more sophisticated approach to risk management. Investment in skills and technology is required, as well as a reassessment of how trade is conducted (letters of credit may become more important, for instance) and consideration of supply chain finance and account receivables programs. For mid-sized companies growing internationally, the last few years have been turbulent. Disruption caused by the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have highlighted the vulnerability of trade flows. Companies are also having to contend with higher inflation, rising interest rates, a liquidity squeeze (in some markets), and increasing FX volatility. Against this uncertain backdrop, mid-cap companies are having to retool their businesses. Relationships with buyers and suppliers, including payment terms and methods, are changing. To succeed, companies should consider the following actions.1. Broaden your buyer base and consider “near-shoring”In the past, many companies have been dependent on one or two large buyers. But the pandemic and geopolitical tensions may have weakened relationships. As part of a recent Citi GPS Supply Chain Finance report, Citi Research recently surveyed 1,169 companies that participate as suppliers in Citi-managed supply chain finance programs. We will share highlights in this article. Suppliers need to broaden the range of buyers they work with. Selling to additional buyers, in a wider range of geographies, can lessen risk and improve resilience. For companies in some sectors, it might even be possible to enter the business to consumer (B2C) market by using online marketplaces. Suppliers also need to be aware of the trend towards “near-shoring” supply chains to avoid long distance logistical disruption. It is yet to be seen if “near-shoring” will change production patterns, but it is understandable companies across many sectors are considering this. 50% of companies surveyed with revenues over $20m had difficulty shipping goods to customers.*   45% of companies surveyed with revenues over $20 million had difficulty forecasting and planning for customer demand.* 2.",493
367,"Diversify your supply chainWhile mid-cap companies are suppliers to larger corporates, many also have complex supply chains of their own. For instance, contract manufacturers depend on suppliers for key components or raw materials. In Citi’s supplier survey, more than a fifth of respondents have difficulty procuring from downstream suppliers. Therefore, diversifying suppliers may reduce the impact of disruption caused by one or two suppliers. It’s important to build relationships with suppliers in multiple geographies to mitigate exposure to geopolitical risk and regulatory change. Companies should also assess the potential for insourcing or vertical integration for critical components to reduce risk.3. Think strategically about payment terms and financeWhile diversification of suppliers and buyers is critical, it’s also important to protect existing business relationships. Mid-cap companies should assess and consider implementing preferential payment terms (such as higher pricing or shorter tenors) for major suppliers or suppliers of critical components. Larger companies may be able to establish supply chain finance (SCF) programs as part of such efforts. However, not all mid-cap companies will have the credit capacity to establish SCF programs. Instead, where possible, companies could seek to join their buyers’ SCF programs. Alternatively, companies should investigate receivables financing solutions, such as insurance-backed, portfolio or bilateral programs. Receivables financing solutions aim to improve liquidity and working capital by enabling you to collect funds more quickly and on mutually beneficial terms. Over 40% of respondents to Citi’s supplier survey are seeking financing earlier in the commercial cycle, such as at the purchase order stage. 23% of companies surveyed with annual revenues less than $20m have an issue with prohibitive financing costs / difficulty accessing financing.*4. Develop a risk management plan and resource it properlyDiversifying the range of buyers that companies work with is the first step in managing the risks associated with changing buyer behavior. Mid-cap companies should also identify potential risks and develop a plan to mitigate them so they can respond effectively should disruption occur. One risk is the potential for the credit profile of a buyer to deteriorate. Suppliers should consider building a credit risk management framework to minimize losses and processes to monitor payment patterns. Banks and factoring companies may help mitigate this credit risk to an extent by purchasing the obligations of the buyer and suppliers. This transfers risk at a low cost while optimizing cash flows. A risk management approach is likely to require investment in people.",485
368,"While the company owner may have established relationships with buyers a while ago, the imperative to diversify buyers and suppliers and the complexity of today’s environment requires risk management specialists. Similarly, suppliers may benefit by using technology designed to manage risk. Automation and digital payment solutions – provided by banks, FinTech's or other partners – may help companies to monitor disruption in near real time and respond more effectively by raising red flags about late payments from buyers or disruption to critical components. 71% of companies surveyed with annual revenues over $20m have difficulty with increased costs of goods / raw materials.*5. Expand your network: you don’t have to do everything yourselfMany mid-cap companies have limited human resources and investment budgets. They should consider working with industry associations, multi-lateral associations, chambers of commerce and government organizations such as export agencies when developing a risk management strategy. Often these entities can provide access to technology that helps to better manage risk. Government organizations such as export agencies may help companies to gain access to a wider range of buyer and supplier relationships. These organizations have programs that support the development of economies by promoting trade in certain goods and services. They are usually backed by the sovereign and can either fund these projects directly or provide guarantees via other financial institutions. Citi works with many of these agencies to help clients.6. Reconsider how you pay and get paidAs companies begin to work with new buyers and suppliers, it is essential they rethink their payment terms and ways to ensure they match their risk appetite. While most trade remains on open account, the use of trade finance instruments, including documentary collections, letters of credit (LCs), and guarantees or standby letters of credit has surged in recent years as risk has increased through the need of new trading partners. In Asia documentary services remains 85% of bank intermediated trade finance at $7.7 trillion and globally LCs increased 2% from 2018 - 2021**. 7. Think carefully about how you manage your inventoryThe changing marketplace means that companies should carefully assess their inventory and segregate it into critical and non-critical categories. More than 50% of respondents to Citi’s supplier survey anticipate ongoing disruption in 2023.  Companies may need to be more proactive in their inventory management which could result in stockpiling critical components. Higher inventory levels tie up working capital.",477
369,"However, banks may be able to leverage critical components or raw materials as additional collateral for asset-based lending or inventory financing to prevent cash flow being drained. At the same time, companies may need to implement “just-in-time” inventory management for non-critical components to lower their working capital requirements.8. Consider ESG initiatives and strengthen your downstream supply chainESG has become a board level agenda item.  To be competitive and relevant, mid-cap companies are increasingly thinking about ensuring compliance with disclosure requirements with external benchmarks which make them eligible for various ESG incentives. While this can could require initial investment, the opportunities make it worthwhile – perhaps even essential – for survival. In reference to point 5, there are plenty of multi-lateral agencies that can provide support and incentives here. It is also important to provide incentives for downstream suppliers so the whole ecosystem is sustainable. Mid-cap companies should consider how their own suppliers could be equally or more exposed to market uncertainty and disruptions. Strengthening the downstream supply chain is as crucial as the upstream. One of the ways which banks like Citi are helping is via the introduction of deep-tier sustainable supply chain finance programs in which downstream suppliers are reviewed for their ESG credentials and provide access to liquidity at preferential rates using the credit of the ultimate buyers. 62% of suppliers surveyed are expanding second-tier supplier networks to increase resiliency.*Citi’s Solutions for Commercial Trade (click to expand)We hope these suggestions are useful.

371,"global insights commercial bank taking a holistic view of supplier payments. Taking a Holistic View of Supplier PaymentsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Industrials CompaniesArticle01 Mar 2021Taking a Holistic View of Supplier PaymentsCommercial BankShareDownloadSupply chain finance and virtual card accounts have a crucial role to play in unlocking working capital opportunities.The COVID-19 pandemic means that the outlook for firms in many countries remains precarious given sporadic lockdowns and considerable uncertainty about the national and global economy over the medium term. When times are tough, companies are more reluctant to draw on their revolving credit facilities and invariably place greater emphasis on unlocking working capital, which has long been a key metric for treasurers and CFOs. The past year has been no different: companies are looking for new ways to optimize their cash conversion cycle. At the same time, most companies have seen a drop in their Travel & Entertainment (T&E) card spend – as much as 80% in some instances – as a result of remote working and restrictions on domestic and international travel. Many companies see income share, also known as rebates, as a revenue line to invest back in the business - for example funding new treasury workstation technology. The solution to both these challenges is to take a holistic look at accounts payable (AP). Historically, there has been a tendency – among both banks and companies – to see each type of supplier spend in isolation and try to find an appropriate solution. Given today’s challenges, it makes sense to adopt a fresh approach. By looking across their supplier base, companies can ensure that no opportunities to optimize working capital are overlooked. Citi Commercial Bank does this by reviewing clients’ AP files and analyzing their suppliers, spend patterns, geography, payment terms, payment instruments, and many other variables using sophisticated tools. Suppliers are then segmented – for example, into high value, low volume spend or low value, high volume spend – so that solutions such as supply chain finance (SCF) and virtual card accounts (VCA) can be deployed in tandem to deliver working capital efficiency across the payments continuum. Supply chain finance comes to the fore Once only the preserve of large multinationals, SCF is now a mainstream tool that companies of varying sizes can take advantage of.",464
372,"Setting up an SCF program costs nothing for a buyer and offers a proven way to enhance working capital by enabling buyers to extend payment terms to their suppliers, which results in improved DPO. While at first suppliers might be hesitant to accept longer terms, especially given the current economic environment, SCF also provides significant benefits to a company’s supplier base. Suppliers can benefit by selling their receivables to banks like Citi at a borrowing cost comparable to the buyers’ own cost and, in doing so, get paid at a much quicker pace. This, indeed, helps to strengthen supplier relationships, provide additional visibility, and enhance supply chain stability. In an SCF program, the buyer’s bank purchases suppliers’ receivables and then advances funds to the supplier. This enables suppliers to get paid earlier, improving their days sales outstanding (DSO). SCF leverages the buyers’ superior credit rating so the effective cost of finance is much lower cost than suppliers would ordinarily pay. This is particularly preferential for suppliers that are non-rated or based in countries where the cost of borrowing can be quite high. Suppliers can also choose to sell their receivables to Citi at will, giving suppliers flexibility and additional liquidity at will. It is important for a bank or SCF provider to have the expertise, platform capabilities and global reach to facilitate engagement with the client’s supplier base regardless of their jurisdiction, language, and time zone. This helps to ensure that robust support is available throughout the onboarding process. When assessing a client’s AP files for working capital optimization opportunities, Citi checks to see if any suppliers are part of SCF programs run by other Citi clients, which might indicate suitability to take part in another program. Other potential SCF targets are identified by scale of spend, the supplier’s importance to the client or their business segment. The supplier outreach is very collaborative and Citi will work very closely with the company’s procurement team to ensure alignment. VCA helps fill the spend gap With T&E spend sharply lower due to COVID-19, companies need to target other B2B areas to close the spend gap and protect their card program rebates, which are tiered according to spend. Indirect non-travel spend can take many forms, and much of it is not on companies’ radar when it comes to working capital efficiency. Categories such as telecoms, ad or publishing spend, and office or computer equipment are prime candidates for payment via VCA.",496
373,"As with SCF, Citi can analyze AP files to help companies find suitable suppliers for VCA; these are then checked against Mastercard and Visa databases to ascertain if they accept cards; many longstanding suppliers are paid by check or wire simply because these arrangements were put in place many years ago; suppliers may have subsequently begun to accept cards. Alternatively, some suppliers may already be paid by purchasing card; moving to VCA can lower administrative costs and improve control. Moving spend onto VCA does more than just increase companies’ rebate and improve return on investment: it also improves working capital efficiency. By moving B2B spend to VCA, companies can leverage the card statement cycle to increase their cash float and enhance their working capital. In addition, they can potentially extend terms beyond the immediate payment usually associated with cards. There are also benefits for merchants’ working capital. Most merchants are happy to trade off card-related costs in return for getting paid earlier. While they have to pay card fees, those vendors targeted by VCA usually already accept card payments and will likely have added a small premium to their pricing to account for interchange and other card-related costs. For the buying company, moving spend to VCA has a number of additional benefits. VCA can be easily integrated into cash management and payment solutions, making implementation quick and straightforward. VCA is also more secure and easier to reconcile; paper-based processes can be switched to a web-based portal or even integrated into the company’s ERP system using APIs, so that payments are made direct from the company’s own systems. Savings of as much as 80% are possible compared to a traditional purchase order process involving checks or wire payments; in addition, AP staff can be freed up for more value-added tasks. Furthermore, VCA generates a unique 16-digit virtual and cardless account number for each specific transaction, and offers embedded and enhanced controls such as credit limits, usage timeframes, and the ability to restrict merchant types, all of which can be conveniently set up by program administrators. VCA also provides simplified reporting capabilities and offers visibility into where and how purchases are made by employees. Companies can then use this information to potentially negotiate supplier discounts. Today’s challenges present an opportunity for spend optimization The challenges facing companies as a result of the pandemic have rightly prompted companies to take a fresh look at their spend and find ways to optimize their cash conversion cycle.",480

376,"global insights commercial bank the healthcare staffing challenge finding new ways to be efficient. The healthcare staffing challenge: finding new ways to be efficientOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle13 Jul 2022The healthcare staffing challenge: finding new ways to be efficientCommercial Bank·ContributorsShareDownloadThe pandemic has intensified many of the challenges facing the healthcare sector, chief among them the shortage of both clinical and non-clinical staff. This shortage of workers is having a number of direct and indirect impacts on costs, causing healthcare providers to look for help. Fortunately, there are several key efficiencies that banks can enable, which we explore in this article.A dire situation One of the hallmarks of the past year has been staffing shortages in many sectors. Dubbed ‘The Great Resignation’, millions of Americans quit their jobs during the pandemic, with the trend gathering pace as the economy rebounded when lockdowns were lifted. These shortages have been particularly acute in the healthcare sector, as the industry was already suffering from shortages even before COVID-19, and it only got worse when non-medical treatment was put on hold in 2020.   Staff shortages mean that some healthcare providers are unable to provide the services that patients want, which will cut revenue and profit (and put pressure on valuations). In the longer term, if healthcare providers cannot deliver timely and high-quality services, patient satisfaction and quality of care could suffer. Ultimately, providers could suffer reputational damage. A vicious circle could also emerge, with employees working overtime to fill gaps, undermining employee satisfaction and prompting staff to leave.   Healthcare’s response: one step forward, two steps back In response to the challenges with attracting and retaining staff, many providers have resorted to deploying both financial and nonfinancial incentives to fill the gap. But in many cases these measures have driven costs up even further, both directly and indirectly.   For instance, some organizations have started raising wages to attract new hires. In addition to the predictable impact on incremental expenses, this also creates a new problem – the potential for further dissatisfaction with existing staff, which may lead to even higher rates of turnover. Ultimately, wages may need to rise across the board to maintain a content workforce.   Other practices have been experimenting with bonuses.",463
377,"If these are performance-related, a practice might for example award administrative staff bonuses based on their scheduling efficiency, or at companies making an acquisition, bonuses might be dependent upon the successful integration of a new practice. Some are also awarding sporadic bonuses, or signing-on bonuses for new hires. The latter approach creates similar challenges with existing staff, who were not awarded the same benefit, and no matter what kind of bonus is awarded, costs increase accordingly.   Recognizing the cost implications of the above strategies, still others are trying to plug the gap via non-financial incentives. These usually focus on improving employee satisfaction. For example, some healthcare providers are offering non-clinical or support staff flexibility about where they work or expanded benefits. Others are enhancing their organizational culture to make employees feel more appreciated, by closing on the weekends or paying for employees to stay at a country club. While these options save on expense, they may not have the same impact as a bonus or wage increase.   How can banks help? It is clear that healthcare providers’ staffing shortages are not going to be resolved in the short term. While providers have begun to raise prices (especially where companies operate a fee-for-service model), they are unlikely to be able to keep pace with higher staffing costs. Where services are reimbursed by an insurance company or Medicare and Medicaid, the gap between fees and costs will be greater still. Some impact on profitability is therefore inevitable. In response, healthcare providers are having a tough time improving efficiency, especially in relation to administration and accounting services. There are often solutions available from banks (or third-party providers) that can help.   For instance, solutions are available to automate revenue cycle management. Some of these leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to streamline billing, collections and reconciliation. Others are integrated into banking portals or enterprise resource planning solutions that healthcare companies already use, improving efficiency further. Some solutions automatically pull Explanation of Benefits data and align it with a payment received from an insurance provider.   Automation releases staff from mundane, repetitive (and often paper-based) tasks so that they can concentrate on more valuable and meaningful activities. It therefore not only reduces costs – unleashing funds for growth or service improvements – but by giving staff greater responsibility improves employee satisfaction, potentially making staff retention easier. In addition, automation reduces human error: overworked administrators may miss claim denials from insurance providers, slowing down cashflow; automation can flag denials and other problems in real time.",495
378,"  There may also be opportunities for efficiency gains on the payables side. For example, moving from checks to electronic payments can reduce costs (and improve security) while the use of commercial cards can improve working capital by taking advantage of the card billing cycle.   On a practical level, higher staff turnover has the potential to increase disruption. Companies need to consider a number of practical measures to lessen the impact. For example, it is important to have a clear record of authorized signers and individuals with administration rights for online banking as well as processes such as dual approvals for payments, for instance. That way changes can be made quickly should an individual leave the company.   In Conclusion The pandemic has made an already difficult situation for the healthcare sector even more challenging. No matter how employers choose to tackle it, it appears that risings costs are inevitable. Citi Commercial Bank clients in this sector that have recently conducted compensation reviews – and had success in retaining staff – have found that the market rate for many positions has gone up substantially. With inflation at a 40-year record high, remuneration expectations among employees and potential hires are likely to increase further.   To offset increased staffing and other costs, healthcare providers should seek opportunities to improve efficiency and cut costs across the organization. Many providers still have cumbersome, paper-based processes for billing and reconciliation. Technology, whether provided by banks or third-party providers, can play a major role in automating revenue cycle management. These opportunities can be explored immediately so that companies can begin to reap the benefits and mitigate the risks of the healthcare staffing crisis.   For more information about how Citi Commercial Bank can partner with you and your team please Contact Us Below.   Learn more about Commercial Bank at Citi or contact usTo help us put you in contact with the right person, please answer the following questions.* Are you an existing client with us?SelectRead Citigroup Privacy NoticesbacknextSubscribeSign up to receive our newsletter providing a roundup of recent content and updates on new reports.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",445

386,"global insights commercial bank time for auto suppliers to shift gears with scf. Time For Auto Suppliers To Shift Gears With SCFOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Industrials CompaniesArticle08 Feb 2022Time For Auto Suppliers To Shift Gears With SCFCommercial BankShareDownloadThe squeeze is real in the automotive supply chain. The industry has been in the news recently because of an increasing reliance on microchips, which have been in short supply during disruption caused by the pandemic. But the truth is that auto suppliers were dealing with significant pressures on margins and liquidity even before COVID-19, and recent events have only compounded these challenges. With the added burdens, finding working capital in new ways is no longer just a bonus; it’s imperative.Pressures Are Piling Up Prior to the COVID-era supply chain shortages, capital was already starting to dry up in the auto sector. Production methods were changing dramatically in response to the transition to electric vehicles and the introduction of autonomous technology, which in turn required heavy capital investment. The industry also needed to accommodate growing consumer expectations. Buyers now want more advanced technology – such as better infotainment systems and more software options – as well as greater customizability. Gone are the days when nearly every customer drove off the lot with whatever was in stock; many are now willing to wait for a customized vehicle, disrupting OEMs’ traditional models. With capital tied up in investments to address changing customer tastes, many OEMs began extending payment terms in search of liquidity. However, most Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers lack the purchasing power to pass this extension further down the chain, so they had to weather the change and take the margin hit. When COVID-19 resulted in supply chain shortages, the situation became tougher still. For instance, a Tier 2 manufacturer that relies on five separate components to put together its product may now have difficulty obtaining supplies for two of those components. The three that can be sourced must be carried in inventory in preparation for the arrival of the two on order, bloating working capital requirements. Labor shortages, higher natural resources costs, and increased logistical costs have also been added to the mix. Taken together, these liquidity pressures are forcing the supply chain – and especially Tier 1 and 2 suppliers – to look for a fix. The good news is that solutions are available, and there has never been a better time to use them.",495
387,"  A Win-Win Option The tried-and-true method of gaining immediate working capital benefits is an extension of payment terms. Some OEMs have pulled this lever, but Tier 1 and 2 suppliers would potentially inflict irreparable damage on their own counterparties if they tried it themselves, because each successive link down the chain is likely less able to weather an extension. A supply chain finance (SCF) program alleviates this problem by decoupling the buyer’s payment date from the seller’s receiving date, allowing either one to be changed without impacting the other. The win for buyers Using an SCF program, a Tier 2 seat manufacturer could extend terms for its leather or cotton suppliers from 60 days to 90 or even 120 days, for example. This provides the seat manufacturer with an instant boost of 30 to 60 days extra liquidity, but without its suppliers being impacted. The win for sellers In our example, the component suppliers not only avoid the impact of the extension, they can opt to receive payment earlier, on day 15 or even day 10. This immediately helps them gain 45 to 50 days of extra liquidity. Of course, the component suppliers will have to accept a discount on their invoices in exchange for the early payment, but that’s where the second benefit comes in. The discount, which is effectively the cost of finance, is based on the buyer’s credit rating, which is usually superior to the suppliers down the chain. Consequently, the cost of finance is often considerably lower than would be otherwise achievable for the supplier, assuming finance is available at all. This third benefit, readily available low-cost financing, is especially important in countries such as Mexico or China where many auto suppliers are based, and where financing at an affordable rate is difficult to find. Working With the Right Bank While SCF programs have much to offer the automotive supplier sector, it is important to recognize that they vary widely. Given the international nature of the auto supply chain, the extent of banks’ global reach is a key differentiator when selecting a bank for an SCF program. Many auto suppliers now have extensive supply chains in Mexico, China and Eastern Europe – locations where only a handful of global banks have supplier onboarding capabilities. Given the lack of affordable financing in those countries as described above, a program that extends to these countries is particularly crucial.",476
388,"The reputation and financial strength of the bank is also important in gaining supplier buy-in: suppliers are likely to be reassured that a program will deliver the benefits anticipated if a buyer works with a well-known global bank, for example. Implementing an SCF program is relatively straightforward and can take as little as four weeks. While any discussion about term extensions is led by the buying company, the availability of early payment makes this conversation considerably easier. Furthermore, once the supplier has agreed to take part, the bank can onboard them, manage all program communications, provide training and guidance to the buyer’s procurement team, and even help manage internal discussions. Banks typically offer a portal giving visibility into the program as well as providing functionality such as reporting. Citi Commercial Bank data shows the working capital benefits available to auto component companies from implementing an SCF program can amount to tens of millions of dollars a year, while the solution can extend firms’ cash conversion cycle by more than 20 days. Moreover, once companies appreciate the benefits of programs – both in terms of improving their working capital and strengthening supplier relations – many go on to expand them to new geographies or supplier segments, generating additional gains. As the auto industry enters a period of historic change, SCF will have a crucial role to play in enhancing working capital throughout the supply chain and helping companies prepare for the future.   UP NEXTArticleCompanies look to shift supply chain to Southeast AsiaCommercial BankArticleTaking a Holistic View of Supplier PaymentsCommercial BankVideoSimplifying Trade FlowsCommercial BankLearn more about Commercial Bank at Citi or contact usTo help us put you in contact with the right person, please answer the following questions.* Are you an existing client with us?SelectRead Citigroup Privacy NoticesbacknextSubscribeSign up to receive our newsletter providing a roundup of recent content and updates on new reports.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",414

390,"global insights commercial bank understanding the mobility ecosystem. Understanding the mobility ecosystem within industrialsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Industrials CompaniesArticle02 Jun 2023Understanding the mobility ecosystem within industrialsCommercial BankShare When considering the trends facing our Industrials clients, at Citi Commercial Bank (CCB) we review the various Industrials sub-sectors in which our clients operate. These sub-sectors include Capital Goods, Automotives, Paper & Packaging, Transportation & Logistics, Metals & Mining, Aerospace, Building & Construction, or Chemicals. Over time, CCB has seen a new industrials ecosystem emerge, one in which the lines have blurred across the various Industrials sub-sectors and expands/overlaps with other industries. Let’s consider an example: The Mobility Ecosystem. Industry data suggests approximately 30%- 40% of EV costs are batteries which involve both metal and chemical processes. Continuous innovation in battery technology has been critical to enabling the EV revolution. Increased energy density (longer vehicle range) and lower cell costs (consumer affordability) continue to drive the innovation landscape.  To accommodate, EV charging companies are investing in EV charging infrastructure which offers new opportunities for manufacturers of charging equipment. With the rising success of lithium battery in vehicles, trends show expansion to aircrafts as well – eVTOLs (Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing vehicles). The perspective of the air taxi will change how people travel in the future.  The other aspect of Mobility is technology, which has fundamentally changed the function of cars to be smart, connected, and shared. Citi Research estimates that by 2030, we can expect technology content to be 50% by value of a typical smart car. A smart car moves its passengers around without a human hand necessarily touching the steering wheel, and at the same time offers an in-journey array of entertainment choices. This will not only change the experience of individual consumers but also transform the Auto OEM (Auto Manufacturers) business model, as well as the overall transportation and logistics industry. The entire Mobility ecosystem requires industry players across the specialized sub-sectors to work together towards building a more advanced future.  Because we serve clients across these sectors around the world, Citi Commercial Bank and our partners across Citi, have a unique view of this ecosystem.",484
391,"global insights commercial bank unlocking global growth funding expansion for smes. Unlocking global growth: funding expansion for SMEsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle10 Jul 2023Unlocking global growth: funding expansion for SMEsFor medium-sized companies entering the complex realm of international banking services and regulations, a consolidated approach is key.Commercial BankShare*This partner content was produced by the Financial Times on behalf of Citi Commercial Bank For any SME (small and medium enterprises), scaling up and growing internationally is a prospect that is exciting and daunting in equal measure. From navigating that growth through economic headwinds to securing extra investment for logistics, marketing, infrastructure and staff, it’s a challenge that can be immensely rewarding, as long as the right framework is in place.  For San Francisco-headquartered mobile payment processing company Boku, rapid growth brought with it a new focus on collaboration with specialist partners. In 2009, backed by venture capital, the company embarked on a mission to create a seamless global payment mechanism that would transform the way people transact.  Boku allows consumers to charge digital goods and services to a range of local payment methods, including mobile phone bills and digital wallets. Its success has seen companies such as Apple, Spotify, Microsoft and Netflix come on board as customers and, since users need no credit card to pay with Boku it has also been hailed as a boon to people who remain unbanked, of whom there are 1.4bn globally. As the firm moved into new markets, requirements became more demanding and complex. “At the beginning, in most of the places we were collecting money, we could rely on the telecommunication companies to get it to us relatively straightforwardly. As time went on, though, we scaled up, became a public company, supported new products like mobile wallets, and it was clear we needed to upgrade our banking partner”, says Boku CEO Jon Prideaux Regulatory challenges can cost time and money The challenge for Boku was that its customers needed to accept payments through a variety of different means, such as WeChat Pay, Alipay and India’s United Payments Interface (UPI). However, these local mobile-first systems tend to only operate in one country, adding to banking and regulatory complexity.",462
392,"“In Indonesia, for example, if you want to accept payments from Indonesians, then realistically you have to cover four separate mobile wallets, all of which are different and incompatible,” says Prideaux. “That's a heavy lift for our customers – so the seamless settlement position is an important part of what we do.”  As the regulatory hurdles increased for Boku – from anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer (KYC) rules to differing ways in which the movement of funds must be handled in every country (Boku currently has 93 bank accounts in 27 countries) – Prideaux started a relationship with Citi Commercial Bank to help Boku with financing support and tools to help navigate local banking challenges. Citi's longstanding presence in various countries proved to be a significant advantage for Boku. With over a century of operations in some of the countries Boku was involved in, Citi's integration into domestic clearing and payment networks allowed Boku to operate as if it were a local company. This seamless connectivity not only reduced operational barriers but also provided Boku with access to local insights and market intelligence, enabling it to tailor their offerings and better serve its global customer base. International capabilities Thierry Jenar, Global Industry Head for Digital, Tech & Comms at Citi Commercial Bank, has been the bank’s lead for the Boku partnership since it launched in 2020. He points out that Boku’s rapid expansion – and the banking challenges that come with it – creates a situation that will be familiar to many SMEs. “Companies tend to focus on banking locally as they expand internationally, because it's a little bit easier to set up,” he says. “However, while that can be expedient at first, it ends up creating problems down the road, especially as you grow, because you don't have a consolidated banking strategy and platform. Who wants to deal with, say, 15 banks around the world when you can deal with one?” With Citi on board, Boku was now able to make payments in over 100 countries as if it were operating locally and thus, benefiting from the local clearing networks. It is SMEs such as Boku that Jenar feels represent a great fit for Citi Commercial Bank. The ‘sweet spot’ for him and his team is on young companies with high growth and international trajectory. “Boku was the perfect client,” he says. “Relatively small, but with room to grow, through acquisitions.",498

394,"global insights commercial bank what is on treasury s radar. What is on treasury’s radar?OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle10 Nov 2023What is on treasury’s radar?Five themes for 2024Commercial BankShare The attention of treasury professionals is turning to 2024 and the challenges and opportunities that lie in store. The macroeconomic and geopolitical outlook remains uncertain and treasury is aware of the need to be prepared for external shocks. But there is broad optimism among many mid-sized companies about the potential of technology to improve efficiency, enhance visibility and control, and support the evolution of treasury. Below we identify some of the key themes for treasury in 2024, based on conversations with Citi Commercial Bank clients in recent months and some of the discussions and debates that took place at AFP 2023, held in San Diego in October. 1. Automation is the route to simplification and efficiency Treasury is laser focused on improving operational efficiency and simplifying processes with the goal of becoming more nimble. Increasingly, automation is seen as key to these objectives. Mid-size companies should look to their banks for automated solutions that can help them achieve their goals. Banks are also the custodians of huge volumes of data that can be used internally for better informed decision-making; companies can work with their bank to harness this data to improve treasury efficiency. For instance, Citi Commercial Bank can harness clients’ data (including from third-party bank accounts), deploy analytics to compare clients’ treasury structures to industry best practice, and suggest practical changes that deliver tangible results. 2. Financial functions are converging Treasury, Accounting and Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) teams are increasingly integrated, with many mid-sized companies creating a more collaborative and strategic finance approach within organizations. By combining their expertise, these teams can provide more comprehensive and insightful financial analysis. This can be used to support better informed strategic decision-making relating to resource allocation, capital investments, and organic and inorganic growth strategies. As the role of treasury evolves and accounting and FP&A are added to its ecosystem, these financial functions need to leverage the synergies that come from bringing their capabilities together. To do this, they need access to tools that support proactive business intelligence and predictive analytics so that they can provide insights to the business based on data rather than intuition. 3.",476
395,"AI is a leapfrog technology for treasury Artificial Intelligence (AI) has captured the world’s imagination in recent months, and treasury is no exception. AI and Machine Learning (ML) will increasingly be used as part of efforts to automate processes within treasury. For example, ML can facilitate more effective matching of incoming payments with remittance information, making reconciliation easier and accelerating the speed of cash within the organization. Many companies are looking to AI to boost cybersecurity. Banks are likely to explore using the technology to accelerate onboarding and ERP integration.  Banks are working to use AI to identify efficiency gains in a company’s liquidity structures based on regulations in specific markets, enabling greater consolidation of cash and potentially higher returns from short-term investments. 4. Security and controls are strategically important Mid-size companies are increasingly reliant on digital technologies for their operations, including customer relationship management, financial systems, and collaboration tools. While digitization of operations and interactions with customers delivers efficiency benefits, this increased reliance on digital systems makes companies more vulnerable to cyberattacks and fraud. Security controls to tackle fraud and protect financial data are attracting increased regulatory scrutiny and – given the potentially huge economic and reputational losses – are no longer concerns solely for Accounts Payable or IT teams. Instead, they have become board-level priorities and assumed strategic importance for many organizations. 5. ESG moves up the agenda Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues have gained increased prominence for mid-size companies over the past decade – albeit at a different pace in different regions and with a varying emphasis on ‘E’, ‘S’ and ‘G’ objectives. Companies are increasingly incorporating ESG considerations into business strategy and are also seeking treasury solutions that reflect their sustainability commitment and focus, while still aligning with broader treasury goals. For example, commercial cards can build awareness of ESG issues across the organization and act as a statement of intent. A portion of a company’s rebates from spend can be donated to an ESG objective, such as a reforestation program. At the same time, the company benefits from a period of interest free credit that enhances its working capital (which is a priority for many companies given the interest rate environment). Similarly, sustainability-linked supply chain finance (SCF) programs can deliver attractively priced finance to suppliers in return for (independently verified) improvements in their ESG performance. This not only helps companies to achieve their ESG objectives but strengthens supplier relationships and bolsters supply chain resilience.",497

What’s trending in digital, technology & communicationsOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Digital Technology & Comms CompaniesArticle14 Feb 2023What’s trending in digital, technology & communicationsCommercial BankShareDOWNLOAD       What does 2023 have in store for Digital, Technology and Communications companies? As Citi Commercial Bank’s Global Head for these sectors, I’ve been talking with our mid-sized clients about what they expect from the upcoming year. There is still a large amount of uncertainty, as would be expected, but what is certain is that digital transformation will continue to be critical as businesses worldwide scale up. Innovation will lead to new opportunities, and our clients in this space are already gearing up to take advantage of the shifts. Here are 10 trends that we predict will have a big impact this year.   1. 5G networks and edge computing: With the widespread deployment of 5G networks, we can expect to see a significant increase in the use of edge computing, which allows data to be processed closer to the source, resulting in faster and more efficient responses.   2. Internet of Things (IoT): The continued expansion of IoT will lead to an increased demand for connected devices, data analytics, and security solutions.   3. Cybersecurity: It continues to be an increasingly important concern as the number of connected devices and the amount of data being stored and shared continue to grow, pushing towards a Zero Trust environment.   4. Zero Trust: There is no longer a defined perimeter inside which every user, device, or access point is inherently trusted. Every entry must be validated using all data points available to provide context to the requested connection. The security architecture for this stage requires more automation and large amounts of computing power. It also requires the breakdown of complex processes into more manageable units to contain breaches, all leading to transformational changes to the security organization and the enterprise itself.   5. Cloud-based services: They will become even more prevalent as companies look for ways to reduce costs, increase scalability and improve security.   6. Personalization: E-commerce companies are using data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to personalize the shopping experience for individual customers, from product recommendations to personalized marketing campaigns.   7.",482

You've Raised the Funds, Now What?OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountOur Solutions for Healthcare CompaniesArticle01 Apr 2022You've Raised the Funds, Now What?Commercial BankContributor(s):  Rory Clark, Senior Vice President, Technology Venture Banking (Citi Commercial Bank)ShareDownloadFast-growing, VC-backed companies in sectors such as technology, e-commerce, life sciences, and emerging mobility focus heavily on raising capital to support their rapid expansion, but often put an investment strategy for this new influx of cash on the backburner. When funding comes in big rounds – as it usually does for these industries – even the smallest return can make a big difference.Citi Commercial Bank works with a wide variety of disruptors, from FoodTech, Ag Tech, and biotech to software companies, online marketplaces and the electric vehicle ecosystem. These companies spend a significant amount of time sourcing funding and planning their next major lifecycle event such as an IPO or capital raise – and rightly so. Sustained rapid growth is only possible if funds are available; financial planning is therefore critical to future success. However, we have found that only a small percentage of these companies give investment planning much thought or know what to do with cash once it is in hand. As a result, many firms are missing out on potential returns from their surplus balances.   Asking the Right Questions The extended period of low interest rates may have conditioned some companies to think of investment strategies as a waste of valuable time, especially when the focus is on business growth. But funding rounds for disruptor companies can be enormous: even small differences in the return this cash generates can be significant. Moreover, technology, life sciences, and disruptive consumer and industrial firms operate in intensely competitive environments, where the smallest advantage can be make or break. It is therefore even more important to think about the options for squeezing the most out of any cash on hand, especially now that the low interest rate environment is starting to show signs of change. Not every company finds itself with large amounts of surplus cash.",432
399,"But all firms should, as best practice, ask themselves some basic questions to determine how much, if any, of their cash can be put to better use: Am I still burning cash? If a business has a high cash burn, usually in the earlier stages of growth, it is prudent to keep 6-12 months’ worth of anticipated cash burn in operating balances to cover expenses. If a company has a buffer of more than 6-12 months, the surplus can potentially be invested. Firms that already have positive cash flow are likely to have established the minimum cash level they need to maintain on account; any excess can be invested. Am I funding an M&A event and, if so, when? If an M&A event is imminent, it may make sense to keep the required amount liquid. If the timeline is further out, companies could consider investing the earmarked funds for 6-9 months (to match with the timeline of the transaction). Do I have a lot of excess cash? In one of the more obvious scenarios where an investment strategy might make sense, if a funding round is successful enough to generate four years’ worth of cash burn for example, any balance in excess of 12 months’ cash burn that isn’t earmarked for M&A or debt repayment can be considered excess liquidity and ripe for investment.   Reviewing the Options If a company’s answers to the questions above point to an opportunity, it’s time to start thinking about the available investment options. There is no one-size-fits-all approach for investment, and every Citi client is reviewed individually before we present possible options. Our guidance is aligned with a company’s overarching investment policy; if no policy exists, we can help create one. The instruments that a company can utilize will differ based on one of two main objectives – it’s also possible the company will think about both. Maximizing returns: If, after review, a company decides that making a return on idle balances is desired, there are several investment opportunities, both short- and medium-term, that can deliver modest but meaningful returns.

As Geopolitical Strife Endures, Tailwinds DevelopOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle02 Mar 2023As Geopolitical Strife Endures, Tailwinds DevelopGlobal InsightsShareEconomic uncertainty has become a stubborn constant as geopolitical tensions persist. Against this backdrop, are green shoots appearing? Citi Research’s Nathan Sheets and team look at these themes in recent reports.Even as geopolitical tensions keep investors off balance, signs are appearing that certain economic tailwinds may be gathering strength. Take the January US payrolls report. It showed booming job creation, led by the services sectors. That’s a reversal of the early days of the pandemic, when US and global consumers rotated their spending away from services - ostensibly to avoid face-to-face contact - toward goods. Now, as the pandemic broadly recedes, consumers are returning to services. Citi Research’s Nathan Sheets and team reckon this rotation back to services still has a way to go.  Real Consumption by Expenditure   © 2023 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission.  Source: Citi Research, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Haver Analytics    Consistent with this, the chart above displays the major components of consumption, all of which fell sharply early in the pandemic. But goods spending quickly bounced back up, surpassing previous levels. The strength of durables spending, in particular, reflected the rotation away from services discussed above, as well as sizable fiscal stimulus payments to consumers. By mid-2021 the surge in goods had played out with spending on durable goods plateauing at about 25% above pre-pandemic levels and non-durables up 11%. In contrast, services spending recovered from the pandemic much more gradually, but it has continued to rise through the past 18 months as goods expenditures have leveled off. Services spending matched its pre-pandemic level in the fall of 2021 and is now up a further 4%. Some of this means that inflationary pressures are currently being driven by services, potentially posing a challenge for central banks. Much of this is easy to reconcile with some of the key features of Citi Research’s broader economic forecast, which points to relatively desynchronized cycles across the major economies.",482
402,"Citi Research economists still see “rolling” country-level recessions impacting various countries and regions different times over the next year or so. They also reckon central banks ultimately will win their battle with services-led inflation although it’s a fight that will likely continue through the end of this year, with meaningful signs of improvement emerging only in 2024. Meanwhile, the US personal saving rate, which surged during the pandemic and remained highly elevated for several quarters, is back in the spotlight. In recent quarters these funds have been drawn down to support consumption against a backdrop of higher inflation and tightening monetary policy. A new report from Citi Research’s Robert Sockin focuses on the question of how much remains and what that does to the outlook for consumption. The benchmark estimates for excess saving come from a recent paper by economists at the Federal Reserve. They found that excess savings peaked at around $2.3trn in mid-2021 and are currently around $1.2trn.  US Saving Rate   © 2023 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission.  Source: Citi Research, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Haver Analytics    The amount of “excess saving” on household balance sheets remains a pivotal factor for the US outlook. The Fed’s estimate assumes households (in the absence of other shocks) would now be expected to save near 9% of their income — almost all monthly saving rates from 1990-2019 were below this level. Less aggressive assumptions for underlying saving behavior raises the Fed’s estimate of excess saving substantially. For example, a framework that puts underlying desired saving in the mid-8% range today increases excess saving to $1.7trn. Saving rates in the 7% range could increase excess saving to near $2trn. That’s to say excess savings could be materially larger than currently believed. For more information on this subject, please see: Global Economics - The Surge in Services Spending—Still Room to Run?

OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle16 Mar 2023Citi’s Global Theme Machine: What’s New for 2023? Global InsightsShareA new report from Citi Research’s Josie Gerken presents the latest iteration of Citi’s Global Theme Machine, an increasingly rich data set offering powerful research capabilities in understanding thematic investing. Citi Research’s Global Theme Machine is now in its second decade. This year’s annual rebalance introduces eight new themes. The Theme Machine has morphed over the past decade to take account of emerging innovations and changes in society, as well as geopolitical and economic challenges. With an enriched set of data, the Theme Machine can further our understanding of the relative appeal of thematic investing, how this investment style has evolved over time, and how it compares to more traditional investment approaches. For 2023, the Theme Machine maps almost 6,000 stocks to 93 themes. That is more than 32,000 mappings in total. For a full write-up on how the Theme Machine works and how it can help, see the full report. But here’s just a little more on the eight new themes that have been added this year. What’s New? The 2023 rebalance of the Global Theme Machine includes eight new themes to the full suite of, now, 93 themes. These include Beautiful People (a Consumption theme), PropTech (a Financial theme), Feminine Health & FemTech, Fighting Obesity, and Mental Wellness, which all relate to Health Care. Then there is one new Industrial/Environment Trends theme – Greening The Home. And lastly come two IT-focused themes: Smart Home and Creator Economy. These are laid out in a bit more detail in the following figure: New Themes for 2023 and Definitions © 2023 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission.Source: Citi Research The mappings are new for this year, but the cumulative performance of these stocks aggregated at the exposure level over the past three years are shown in the next figure: Past 3-year Cumulative Returns for New Themes for 2023 © 2023 Citigroup Inc.",478
408,"No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission.Source: Citi Research, MSCI From a performance perspective, the theme Creator Economy generated impressive returns following the drop in the market in February 2020; this is probably in part a consequence of changes related to working from home and greater dependence on digital products and services during lockdowns. It is also a consequence of growth-type sectors -- a style which outperformed during the first year of the pandemic. Three of the new themes have delivered decent returns on an absolute basis and in excess of a global market index since January 2020. Greening The Home, for example, outperformed the MSCI World Index by 3.7% with slightly lower volatility. The new Health Care-related themes have not fared quite as well. Greening The Home, PropTech, and Smart Home all have notably lower price/book ratios. From an EPS growth perspective – which analysts have noted in the past is a typical driver of theme performance in the future – several of the themes are an improvement versus MSCI World: Beautiful People, Creator Economy, Feminine Health & FemTech, and Greening The Home stand out.

It’s a philosophical question with an enduring resonance. The first graph below shows trailing EPS for the MSCI World over the past 50 years. The general direction is up, with earnings growing at a compound 6% pa over the period. However, there have been significant setbacks along the way, usually coinciding with major global economic slowdowns. The average earnings fall was 31%, with the biggest starting in 2007 when MSCI World EPS fell by 61%. The longest recession began in 1989, after which earnings took 4 years to fall 35%.

India’s Inexorable AscentOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle22 Feb 2023India’s Inexorable AscentGlobal InsightsShareIndia is on track to become the world’s third largest economy in five years. A new report by Citi Research’s Surendra Goyal takes a closer look at what’s driving this growth. India is advancing. Last year it accounted for 3.4% of global nominal GDP. That’s up from 1.1% in 1993. That means India is now the world’s 5th largest economy at $3.5trillion. It will become the third largest by 2027, accounting for ~4.0% of global GDP, according to the IMF. India’s real GDP growth has been on average approximately 80bps higher than global growth over the preceeding four decades. This growth is based on multiple factors. These include demographics, healthy corporate balance sheets, public capex, investment in cleantech and digitization. Citi Research analysts reckon that medium-term growth of at least 6% is achievable even with more conservative assumptions. India’s recent structural shifts include:  - Policymaking: The introduction of an inflation targeting on the monetary side and from FRBM on the fiscal side. - Inflation and interest rates: Inflation in India averages 6% over the last two decades vs. 9-10% in the two previous decades. And it averages 4% between 2015-19 vs. 9% in the 7 years leading up to that period. The difference between India’s inflation and the rest of the world has moderated. -External sector:  Structural improvements in external balances helped by the resilience of software services exports    Decadal Index Performance in USD MF AUM to GDP in India <20% but has rising sharply over the last two decades    Source: Citi Research, Bloomberg Source: AMFI, Citi Research, Bloomberg  The report says that the upward mobility in income levels of Indian households will likely lead to a shift from a pyramid (c60% lower-income and lower-middle income households) to a diamond structure (c60% middle-income households).",469

Within the sector, spending on technology has become key. For corporates in India more broadly, cash flow remain healthy and balance-sheet indicators are supportive of acceleration in capex. Meanwhile India’s regulatory environment for approvals of infrastructure projects has significantly improved. That said, India’s infrastructure lags behind most of its Asian peers. Citi Research analysts expect infrastructure capex in India to grow at a 9-11% CAGR over the next few years.

Inflation: Not Vanquished Yet OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle15 Mar 2023Inflation: Not Vanquished YetGlobal InsightsShareA recent report from Citi Research’s Nathan Sheets, finds pockets of positivity in the global economy, against a backdrop of a continuing battle with inflation. The health of the global economy continues to offer food for thought.   The growth outlook in China is stronger and less uncertain than Citi analysts envisioned a few months ago. And the euro area, rather than a full-on contraction, is seeing something more like stagnation. Recent data from the US also suggests resilience. That said, the global campaign against inflation still has a long way to go. Specifically, consumer spending on services—and the resultant tight labor markets and services inflation—have momentum.   Global Growth Forecasts Source: Citi Research © 2023 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission   Citi Research economists now see a “less hard” landing for the global economy. They see global growth slowing this year to a below-trend 2.2% pace, from 3% in 2022. This projection is up more than 0.25 of a percentage point from late last year. Even with that upgrade, global growth would remain in the bottom quartile of performance during the past forty years, for context. Next year, Citi Research economists see overall growth rising to 2.6% as the global economy bounces back, albeit slowly. And they recently marked down their probability of a synchronized global recession to 30%. But they still project “rolling” country-level recessions and weakness through the year ahead. Specifically, outright recessions are expected in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Korea, and Russia. But the timing and trajectory of these downturns is likely to vary. In China, the re-opening from Covid is proceeding full steam ahead. The data indicate strong household spending through Chinese New Year. For example, despite the public health challenges that prevailed, movie ticket sales exceeded levels posted both last year and in 2019. In the US, recent data have generally pointed to economic resilience. The January payrolls report showed booming job creation of 517,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.",497
421,"In the Euro area, gas prices have fallen from peaks six months ago, and measures of economic sentiment are climbing back. Fourth-quarter real GDP growth came in at 0.4% (annualized). Germany, in contrast, saw a mild contraction. Accordingly, growth this year is poised to run at 1%, up from our forecast of -0.4% at the end of last year.   Central banks—Focused on Subduing Inflation  DM central banks are in the midst of a vigorous tightening cycle. The Federal Reserve over the past year has lifted rates by 450 basis points. Going forward, Citi expects 25 basis point rate increases at each of the Fed’s next three meetings.   Similarly, Citi Research expects the ECB to push the deposit rate to 3½%, its highest setting in two decades, and sees it holding that well into 2024, until inflation is clearly on its way back to the 2% target. In the UK, Australia, and Canada, policy has also tightened appreciably—and is likely to remain tight. The Bank of Japan remains an important outlier among the DM central banks, with its policy rate still in negative territory. For the EM economies, policy is historically tight among many in Latin America and some in emerging Europe. These central banks began their hiking cycles in 2021 and have remained aggressive, as they have faced domestic as well as global price pressures. In contrast, central banks in emerging Asia have been less vigorous, as domestic inflation has been more muted.   As DM central banks eventually pause their tightening, and global inflationary pressures ebb, the EM central banks where policy is particularly tight should have scope for rate cuts.

Japan’s Corporate Governance Enters New Phase OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle09 Mar 2023Japan’s Corporate Governance Enters New Phase Global InsightsShareA new report from Citi Research’s Ryota Sakagami looks at the long-standing issue of corporate governance standards in Japan - finding progress but also more work to be done. It has been a decade since corporate governance was introduced into Japan’s national growth strategy as part of the Japan Revitalization Strategy. Since then, revisions and updates have been made and there has been some progress. For example, compared with 2015 there has been a big uptick in the proportion of companies with independent or outside directors. Indeed, almost 82% of prime market companies had an independent director share of at least one-third as of 2022 (see chart below). But the fact remains that Japanese firms are still lagging compared with international firms.   Ratio of listed companies in Japan with independent directors, nomination committees, and remuneration committees © 2023 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission.Source: JPX, Citi Research The proportion of female directors is rising but was still only 11% in 2021 compared with 30%-40% for the US and Europe. Cross shareholdings are a particular feature in Japan, and they count as negative in ESG index governance items. Modest progress has seen the average number of names held fall from 65 in 2010 to 43 in 2019, but sales have been limited to small holdings. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg governance scores show improvement for Japanese companies but persistently low levels compared with US and European counterparts. Japanese ESG scores are generally comparatively low but particularly so for governance (see chart below). Comparison of Bloomberg E, S, and G scores in Japan, the US, and Europe © 2023 Citigroup Inc.

424,"On January 30, the TSE published a summary of its discussions over recent months including how steps should be taken to make the “comply or explain” provision of the Corporate Governance Code (CGC) widely known and highlight instances of inadequate explanations, among other measures. At a February meeting, the Council of Experts released its specific requirements for initiatives to improve capital efficiency and stock prices, the details of which are outlined in the full report. Ideas discussed included promoting competition among companies by including a PBR benchmark of 1.0x in the standards for listing on the prime market and restricting the number of stocks in the TOPIX.

One reason companies with high RoE are discounted relative to overseas peers is that the sheer number of companies with RoE below the cost of capital makes the Japanese equity market less attractive overall, thereby hindering the inflow of funds.

425,"global insights global insights latam lessons in inflation. Latam: Lessons in InflationOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle16 Feb 2023Latam: Lessons in InflationGlobal InsightsShareA Citi Research note from Ernesto Revilla looks at some of the important lessons that can be learned from Latam’s recent inflation history, both for the region itself and the rest of the world. What can we all learn from Latam’s recent history in dealing with inflation? Here’s a few lessons: #1 – Inflation can stabilize above the target This might be the most important lesson Latam’s recent inflation journey has to offer. That’s not to say inflation is unanchored, but rather it moves in a different range than authorities are aiming for. Even if that’s the case, the authorities may submit to that above target range because they’ll often conclude that the cost of bringing inflation back target is just too high. The Citi Research note points out that this is important because it shows that higher inflation can become persistent. Past inflation matters for future inflation, the note says. That’s why some countries operate with inflation rates outside their formal targets for long periods. This topic is of course particularly relevant against the backdrop of global inflation. The note says that persistent high inflation usually emerges from a combination of limited central banks’ credibility and a shock that pushes inflation higher. This then ends up being self- perpetuating due precisely to the lack of central bank credibility. On the other hand, when a central bank is credible, a specific shock often has only a temporary effect on inflation, as inflation expectations remain anchored for longer periods. In LatAm, most central banks have inflation controlled within the target range. However, Citi Research analysts pick out two cases that are interesting to look at: Uruguay – Inflation has been consistently above the target range. Only in a fraction of the period from Jan-10 and Dec-22 has inflation stayed within the target. Average inflation for 2010-2019 has not been in the target range during that period (between 3% and 7%) but at 8.3%. And Uruguay’s inflation target is rather high in the first place. México – Although the midpoint inflation target is 3%, the de facto objective is more like 4%.  In 2010-2015, inflation fluctuated around 4%.",499
426,"But rather than hiking to bring average inflation to 3%, authorities instead acted as though 4% was the midpoint target. Only when inflation was consistently above 4% did a substantial hiking cycle begin around 2017.   Mexico and Uruguay are usually above the target range Source: Citi Research   In short, these cases serve as a warning to countries with limited credibility inflation targeting regimes. #2 – Central banks are slow to cut after inflation spikes The Citi Research note says that Brazil and Colombia, between 2015 and 2017, offer comparable episodes to the present, in which inflation went significantly outside the central bank target range. Importantly in these episodes, one year ahead inflation expectations also moved above the upper bound of the range. #3 – When monetary policy turns procyclical It is interesting to note, the analysts say, that monetary policy remained expansionary when economies recovered from the pandemic and the output gaps turned positive again. Put another way, central banks have fallen behind the curve. In Chile, the monetary policy tightened last year even as the economy cooled off. The conclusion, they say, is that monetary policy in LatAm is turning more procyclical. #4 – On the ‘structural’ drivers of inflation Inflation can accelerate due to ‘structural’ reasons. As we’ve mentioned, curbing inflation can become too costly with structural’ factors potentially fueling inflation and making policymakers tradeoffs more challenging.    Inflation expectations have been mostly anchored in LatAm’s big inflation targeters Source: Citi Research, Haver Analytics   In fact analysts found that relative prices have changed markedly in the last couple of years especially in Chile and Colombia and to a lesser extent in Brazil and Peru, something that could create inflationary pressures if these relative prices gaps start normalizing. The main conclusion is that central banks tend to be prudent when easing after an episode of high inflation and unanchored expectations For more information on this subject as inflation remains front of mind for many, please see Latin America Economic Outlook & Strategy – Experienced in inflation: lessons from LatAm first published on January 24th.

427,"global insights global insights mena energy renewables rising. Mena Energy: Renewables RisingOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle14 Feb 2023MENA Energy: Renewables RisingGlobal InsightsShareIn a new report by Citi Research’s Oliver Connor explores the diversification of MENA’s energy investment and how it’s affecting the region’s standing in a lower-cost, lower-carbon global system. As the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region looks set to strengthen its position in global energy this decade, a new report highlights three key themes: Deeper petrochemical integration An accelerating shift to renewables Mega-scale green hydrogen exports, with MENA the most competitive supply source The region supplies nearly a third of global fossil-fuel output. Now a cross region effort to decarbonize the power system will lead to greater use of renewables alongside green-hydrogen export capacity, the report says. The authors note that virtually all MENA investment before the pandemic was focused on hydrocarbons, of which 60% was oil. But oil’s spending’s share is expected to fall to just over a third of the total by 2030, as gas, petrochemicals and renewables advance. Renewable energy is expected to lead that expansion.    MENA Plays A Key Role In Global Primary Energy Supply   © 2022 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission. Source: Citi Research, BP Statistical Review 2022, *primary energy = oil, gas and coal     In the past 30 years the Middle East has on average supplied almost a third of the world’s oil . That’s equivalent to just over 10% of the total energy needs of the world. That’s made MENA a key player in global economic growth and driven economic prosperity across the region. In recent years, OPEC’s aggressive production cuts have forced it to cede market share. But the report points out that the need for higher prices isn’t a question of cost competitiveness but one of fiscal balance. Middle Eastern gas, meanwhile, has gone from a by-product to a prized export commodity since the late 1980s. More than a third of global gas reserves sit in the Middle East- mostly held by Iran and Qatar. And the decarbonzation agenda is driving more gas generation.",480
428," Saudi Arabia, for example is aiming for a 50-50 gas-renewable mix buy the end of this decade.   Global gas investment is likely to focus on new LNG supply, particularly as Europe seeks to replace some 120 million tons of Russian gas per year. The authors see the Middle East, led by Qatar, as playing a key role in delivering the LNG buildout needed.   Renewables Nearly 95% of MENA’s power demand is met by oil, gas and coal. But the drive for deeper decarbonization is poised to change this. Scaling up renewables will be pivotal in achieving the region’s net-zero targets. The shift to electrification will free up capacity to export hydrocarbons and bring economic viability to energy exports in the form of green hydrogen or ammonia. The authors call the pursuit of renewables “a lightning rod for change” across MENA, with many countries seeking to localize supply chains. While China is the engine of global clean-energy manufacturing today, the authors think MENA has the labor supply and resources to build a meaningful local supply chain.   Green Hydrogen The authors see MENA as key also to meeting expected global growth in green hydrogen and say MENA is by far the most advanced region in terms of achieving scale this decade. The authors think MENA could meet virtually all of Europe’s green-hydrogen import target of 10 million tons per year by 2030.   Commodity Chemicals As with oil, Saudi Arabia holds a dominant position in the region. Since the mid-2010s, the advent of U.S. shale and a drive for chemical self-sufficiency in Asia has led to some retreat in market share, but the industry remains an important economic driver. The push for oil and gas growth is a key factor for the petrochemicals sector. Another area of interest is improving chemical yields from oil: Today petrochemical yields are around 45%, but it’s hoped that can be raised to 70% over time.

No More Easy Money: Implications of the Rising Cost of CapitalOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle22 Feb 2023No More Easy Money: Implications of the Rising Cost of CapitalGlobal InsightsShareA new report by Citi Research’s Scott Chronert takes a detailed look at the rising cost of capital and its implications. Money is getting costlier.  After the cost of capital for the S&P 500 fell to a historic low in 2021, monetary policy normalization last year created a sharp valuation reset, and the cost of capital has risen.  In the last year, the cost of equity and debt for the S&P 500 has quickly hit levels not seen since the 1990s, as the chart below shows. And Scott says the cost is likely to settle and endure somewhere close to those 1990s levels. S&P Cost of Capital, 50 years    © 2022 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission.  Source: Citi Research, FactSet, Bloomberg, Haver Analytics  One important factor to consider is how higher capital costs effect the supply of equities. Buyback volume historically has mirrored the cost of equity: when the cost of equity increases, so buyback activity picks up. Valuations are implicitly lower as the cost of equity rises.  Another component is tied to the trade-off between reinvestment opportunities and return of capital. As the cost of capital rises, the set of profitable reinvestment options gets smaller. Management may elect to return capital to shareholders in preference to retaining earnings. Capex and M&A As we’ve discussed, in theory a higher cost of debt cuts the available set of profitable capex opportunities. Over a longer period, this can weigh on earnings growth. In M&A, things are a bit blurrier, the Citi Research note said. A volatile cost of capital seemingly hampers M&A activity. But a higher cost of capital doesn’t necessarily dampen M&A activity.    Announced M&A Volume vs Cost of Capital  © 2022 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission.",461
430," Source: Citi Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver Analytics  As the cost of capital rises, consistent European equity outflows versus the US have contributed to a historically wide valuation gap between the two markets according to a recent report by Citi Research’s Robert Buckland Global Equity Strategy - Fund Outflows: US More Vulnerable Than Europe, first published on January 20th. The MSCI Europe index now trades at a 25% discount to the MSCI US, well above the long run average of 15%.

US Valuations Have Partly Responded to Improving Returns, but in Europe Valuations Have Barely Moved   © 2023 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission. Source: Citi Research    Energy, with a 40% value-gap, is the sector with the biggest value-gap according to a report, first published on January 25th by Alastair Syme entitled  The Role of Trans-Atlantic M&A in Closing Oil’s Value-Gap. In both markets energy equities decoupled from rising oil prices in 2022, but the decoupling of Europe has been even more pronounced. Part of this delta can be explained by portfolio differences, with the US pivoting to shale and Europe to low carbon-- and the latter coming under pressure from rising rates. But Citi analysts see the biggest driver coming from a widening CoE as European investors feel increasing pressure on owning energy equities. Citi analysts see little scope for the political backdrop in Europe to change in a way that would re-align the CoE between the two markets. If anything, European energy policy’s stance against fossil fuels has become more entrenched, they say. Global oil companies have famously consolidated before. But the drivers of the late 1990s consolidation do not look applicable today, the note said.

Protectionism and the US Inflation Reduction ActOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle31 Jan 2023Protectionism and the US Inflation Reduction ActGlobal InsightsShareA new report from Citi Research’s Martin Wilkie looks at the potential fallout from the US inflation Reduction Act, which is causing consternation in the EU over its perceived anti-competitiveness. The global battle to reduce inflation is well and truly on. One of the first casualties could be transatlantic competitiveness. The US Inflation Reduction Act has led to EU complaints that subsidies and tax credits discriminate against products imported into the US, to the potential detriment of EU companies. Could the EU now respond with legislation of its own? The EU has two broad complaints with the Inflation Reduction Act. First, they are concerned that European-produced products will be disadvantaged in the US. Secondly, they also note that US companies won’t be similarly disadvantaged in Europe. As such, US players can receive scale benefits through protection in their home markets and use these to drive market share gains in Europe too. The EU is reported to have noted “at least nine points” in the IRA which may be deemed a breach of international trade rules. It is important to note that the key concern appears to be with the domestic content requirements, rather than the subsidies per se.    European green energy installations are lagging   © 2022 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission. Source: BNEF, Citi Research Estimates    This issue is made even more potent by the EU’s dependence on the green transition in its industrial strategy. Europe has fallen behind in many industries of the future, with ‘green’ sectors such as wind turbines now one of the few where it holds something of a leadership position. Moreover, it still holds a disproportionate share of the legacy auto industry. Should the US and China steal a march on Europe here, it would be painful for the EU’s ambitions. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), through its subsidy largesse, has substantially shifted the playing field towards the USA in renewables development. Firstly, by making project returns so attractive, it makes renewables development more appealing in the US than the EU. Developers who are capacity-constrained are likely to direct their investment dollars to the US over Europe.",489
432,"Secondly, its domestic content provisions are a threat to European suppliers and supply chains. The nationality of the overall manufacturer is not a factor, but having a local supply chain is. The EU thus faces the risk that investment in manufacturing capacity, and thus jobs, may also become skewed to the USA. Under the IRA, wind projects meeting domestic content requirements can receive a 10% uplift to the tax credit they may receive. For projects starting construction before January 2026, this requirement is 45% of total content, rising to 50% for those starting before January 2027, and 55% for subsequent projects.    BEV and PHEV monthly penetration rates in Europe since 2019   © 2022 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission. Source: Citi Research, S&P Global Mobility (IHS)    For electric vehicles to be eligible for tax credits, they must meet two local content hurdles (Institut Montaigne, 15 Dec 22): At least 40% of the critical raw materials used in the battery must be extracted in the US or a country with which it has a free trade agreement, rising to 80% by 2026. At least 50% of battery components must be made or assembled in NAFTA countries, rising to 100% by 2029. Note that, for the purpose of the tax credits, manufacturing in Canada or Mexico counts towards local content requirements, which is helpful for non-US players. The inflation reduction act includes a number of measures aimed at supporting green technologies in the US. Key highlights include: Production tax credits (PTC) for generation of renewable energy, including wind and solar. These have been incorporated for the following 10 years, to 2032. For hydrogen, the IRA introduces a new tax credit of $3/kg for clean hydrogen production (i.e. production with >95% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to conventional hydrogen production using fossil fuels). For light-duty electric vehicles, the tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle was also extended to 2032. To qualify for the credit, vehicles must be below a certain price ($80k for SUVs, vans and pick-up trucks, $55k for other vehicles), and purchasers must be below a certain income.",473

Sports: How Tech is Changing the Game OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle10 Feb 2023Sports: How Tech is Changing the GameGlobal InsightsShareA new report by Anuj Gangahar from Citi Global Insights looks at how wearable devices, virtual reality and augmented reality are having a broad-based and profound impact on how we train for, play and watch sport. Tech and sport are converging. For some sports, the importance of technology is perfectly obvious. Take Formula 1 motor racing, for example. It’s seen by some as more of a technological and engineering arms race than sporting contest. Elsewhere, the unstoppable march of tech is perhaps less obvious. But it’s no less profound. Wear a device that measures your every movement. Use virtual reality to help you see the game more clearly – as a spectator or player. Use augmented reality to view data and analysis in real time superimposed on the field of play and in your normal field of vision. Build a golf club that meets your every ball flight, forgiveness and power need while also providing feedback on your ball striking in real time or to analyze later. Or smash through the two-hour barrier for the marathon wearing running shoes developed in a lab that give you that all important extra pep in your step. With technology improving all the time, the growth of the business of sports tech looks assured. The full report looks into four areas of sports tech in more detail: Wearable devices Virtual Reality Augmented Reality Custom sporting equipment All four are interesting for what’s already going on within them but also for the potential for future growth and development. The report says that that taken as a whole, the sports tech market is well placed to benefit from societies and economies that increasingly put data at their heart. And a post- pandemic focus on health, wellness and playing sport provides added impetus.",396

The other the bounds of ingenuity. But there is a nexus- at least a couple in fact. Pushing our performance to ever greater levels is the essence of what makes sport compelling for most of us. But now, as performance increments are ever harder to come by with advanced training techniques available to all, technology is becoming a differentiator. Integrating technology into training regimes is already happening at the highest levels of global sport. The trickle-down effect is real and visible. And in terms of audience engagement, the value of technology looks just as clear. As competition for viewing rights gets ever fiercer, broadcasters are searching for an edge over the competition. Tech provides a potential point of differentiation and several broadcasters have already entered the fray. Price points and the details of the individual offerings vary but all are designed to increase the attractiveness and depth of the fan experience and keep them coming back for more. As part of the full report we modelled the use of virtual reality and augmented reality in particular sports. For the full methodology and more detailed analysis, see the full report, but here’s a little more on what we found for virtual reality. Given the strong match between VR suitability and the highest revenue sports, incremental revenue opportunities could be significant. The model indicated that the total incremental revenue VR viewing could bring to the sports market by 2030 is estimated to be around $31 billion (yes, $31billion!), an 88% increment to the ticketing revenue and 17% to the sports market.",478

Although AR will become more ubiquitous than VR by 2030, VR is expected to bring higher incremental revenue stream to the global sports market. That’s because: 1) VR is more suitable for at-home viewing and will therefore appeal to a larger audience base; 2) VR content usually enjoys a higher price by offering a larger experiential enhancement to TV viewing than AR to in-stadium spectating.

440,"global insights global insights the wildcards of global commodities. The Wildcards of Global CommoditiesOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle02 Mar 2023The Wildcards of Global CommoditiesGlobal InsightsShareUncertainty abounds where commodities are concerned. A new report from, Citi Research’s Ed Morse looks at some of the potential wildcard scenarios. The new Citi Research report sketches out several wildcard scenarios that could impact commodities, from supply chains to stockpiling, a new gold rush to central bank policy machinations.  Wildcard Scenarios   © 2023 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission.  Source: Citi Research  Here we’ll present a quick run through of the top five of these wildcards- for the full analysis and details of the rest, see the full report. To be clear- these aren’t predictions but scenarios to be mindful of and inform thought. Wildcard 1: A 180 degree turn in weather year on year would lower energy prices If weather patterns were to flip completely vs. last year, the potential for more reliable renewable generation, fewer hurricanes over the Atlantic and less coal production disruption would lead to lower natural gas and coal prices and perhaps even diesel prices too. Renewable power generation in Europe is now much above last year’s level Source: Citi Research, Bloomberg And along with warmer weather and consumers cutting back on demand, natural gas-fired generation has fallen. This could continue throughout the year, as shown below.  Source: Citi Research, Bloomberg Wildcard 2: Global Supply Chains Pressures Reignite Supply chain pressures abated in the second half of last year and are now only somewhat higher than pre-covid levels. Pressures will most likely continue to ease further in 2023, but unexpected shocks could halt progress or even reverse it. If supply chains were to become impaired again, Citi Research analysts reckon it could have material economic implications—most notably for goods inflation which would likely accelerate once more. Renewed goods inflation would make it tougher for central banks to bring inflation back to target levels and lead to tighter than expected policy moves. Citi Global Supply Chain Pressure Index Source: Citi Research, Bloomberg Supply chain disruptions earlier in this cycle were driven by a surge in the demand for goods caused by the pandemic and supply shocks such as lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine.",492
441,"Any reignition of supply chain issues would probably arise from issues like covid getting worse (particularly in China), a recovery in spending on goods, a conflict on a major trading route—or some combination of these. Wildcard 3: Countries move aggressively to stockpile key materials and dramatically accelerate investment in domestic manufacturing and mining Security of raw materials is of increasing importance to policy makers as they look for ways to enable global growth as well as the energy transition. This focus on raw materials is perhaps no surprise given developments in Russia/Ukraine, the worlds high exposure to Taiwanese semi-conductor chips, and an increasing global dependence Chinese EV battery, solar and wind components. Any aggressive stockpiling by regions of materials, including oil and gas, battery metals, EV batteries, semi-conductor chips coupled with accelerating investment in domestic manufacturing and mining--a partial reversal of globalization—could impact global commodity markets over the coming year.  Wildcard 4: Gold trading posts fresh nominal price record, clearing $2,100/oz over the next 9-12M Gold’s ~$425/oz peak-to-trough decline from March-October last year was meaningful, Citi Research analysts say, but the yellow metal actually did well to outstrip its historical beta. If physical demand (e.g. jewelry) stays high, a dovish Fed pivot in the first half could send bullion prices higher later in the year. Gold flows could benefit from a US recession later in 2023, underlining its safe-haven credentials. Wildcard 5: Further deterioration of US-China relations, leading to more sanctions and trade and supply chain disruptions In a worst-case scenario, US-China trade and/or tech conflict could lead to significant disruptions to global trade flows and supply chains. While the degree of damage to the world economy would depend on the scope of such tariffs/sanctions, they would nevertheless likely lead to heightened goods inflation and widespread recessions. Combined with fractured Chinese commodities demand due to lower exports of manufactured goods, and broad risk-off sentiment, this would appear to be a perfect storm for global commodity markets.

448,"global insights global insights us inflation reduction act the eu response. US Inflation Reduction Act: The EU Response OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle23 Feb 2023US Inflation Reduction Act: The EU ResponseGlobal InsightsShareA new report from Citi Research’s Dorothee Rouzet looks at some of the ways in which the EU might respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). EU leaders searching for a response to the IRA are grappling with how to match foreign incentives while not upending the playing field in the EU itself. The IRA sets out plans for $369 billion in subsidies for green industry and energy over a decade. It has led to complaints of discrimination against EU companies.   Implications of the European Response to the US Inflation Reduction Act Source: Citi Research   The EU is expected to respond to the IRA. But what options are available to it? The new Citi Research report explores that question. The team expects a political agreement to emerge that loosens state aid rules for clean technology and repurposes some 300 billion euros of existing funding lines to help governments with less fiscal firepower compete with the US. Scaled-up subsidies and increasingly protectionist policies add to the risks of higher inflation in the medium term, the authors warn.     The EU’s dilemma The report describes the EU’s “business model” as promoting free trade, strict competition rules, and soft power. But doubts about that model now abound given the economic fallout from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the need to accelerate Europe’s energy transition. The pain of Europe weaning itself off Russian gas has raised concerns about other critical economic dependencies.   EU leaders have discussed how to respond, but the authors suspect that response will prove modest due to the EU’s own complexities.   Trade restrictions imposed since 2008 (Global, number) Source: Citi Research, Global Trade Alert, IMF   How much the IRA accelerates green investments may depend on the extent to which subsidies lead to additive investment at the global level rather than diverting investment to the US from elsewhere. The EU has criticized these discriminatory provisions as giving US manufacturers an unfair advantage, as well as for going against global trade rules and diverting industrial plants away from Europe.",462
449,"For the EU, the risk is twofold: IRA subsidies may drive key industrial sectors away from the EU when its industrial competitiveness is already suffering; and a US turn to protectionism poses a more fundamental challenge to core tenets of the EU business model.   Potential responses Discussions under way about an EU “Green Deal Industrial Plan” are likely to extend into the spring. The authors think a political agreement is likely in the first half of this year, one that would outline a short-term response. The authors cite three reasons the response might be muted: The EU must balance its own internal cohesion with its strategic interaction with the rest of the world. A response in kind to US subsidies intended to keep EU industries ashore would almost certainly allow large, deep-pocketed EU members to outspend smaller, more fiscally constrained ones, which could spur industrial relocations within the EU. Access to joint EU funds comes with strings attached, making them less attractive for EU governments. While the IRA is envisioned as fully funded by tax increases, the EU hasn’t achieved clarity on how larger-scale industrial subsidies would be paid for.   Challenges for the UK The report notes the challenges faced by the UK, where broader political disruptions in recent months have left policymakers “on the back foot.” The UK seems particularly exposed to domestic US economic changes associated with the IRA. It also seems likely to be hurt by the broad consequences for international trade. And unlike the EU, the UK is in a particularly weak position in terms of a response. The authors summarize their argument saying that being “a small open economy in an increasingly protectionist global economy is bad news,” adding that the UK is at risk both because of changes in the US economy driven by the IRA and because of the medium-term reaction from the EU.   For more information on this subject, please see: EMEA Equity Research - Macro to Micro: Implications of the European response to the US Inflation Reduction Act Citi Global Insights (CGI) is Citi’s premier non-independent thought leadership curation.

450,"global insights inflation not vanquished yet. Inflation: Not Vanquished Yet OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountReports from the Research TeamArticle15 Mar 2023Inflation: Not Vanquished YetGlobal InsightsShareA recent report from Citi Research’s Nathan Sheets, finds pockets of positivity in the global economy, against a backdrop of a continuing battle with inflation. The health of the global economy continues to offer food for thought.   The growth outlook in China is stronger and less uncertain than Citi analysts envisioned a few months ago. And the euro area, rather than a full-on contraction, is seeing something more like stagnation. Recent data from the US also suggests resilience. That said, the global campaign against inflation still has a long way to go. Specifically, consumer spending on services—and the resultant tight labor markets and services inflation—have momentum.   Global Growth Forecasts Source: Citi Research © 2023 Citigroup Inc. No redistribution without Citigroup’s written permission   Citi Research economists now see a “less hard” landing for the global economy. They see global growth slowing this year to a below-trend 2.2% pace, from 3% in 2022. This projection is up more than 0.25 of a percentage point from late last year. Even with that upgrade, global growth would remain in the bottom quartile of performance during the past forty years, for context. Next year, Citi Research economists see overall growth rising to 2.6% as the global economy bounces back, albeit slowly. And they recently marked down their probability of a synchronized global recession to 30%. But they still project “rolling” country-level recessions and weakness through the year ahead. Specifically, outright recessions are expected in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Korea, and Russia. But the timing and trajectory of these downturns is likely to vary. In China, the re-opening from Covid is proceeding full steam ahead. The data indicate strong household spending through Chinese New Year. For example, despite the public health challenges that prevailed, movie ticket sales exceeded levels posted both last year and in 2019. In the US, recent data have generally pointed to economic resilience. The January payrolls report showed booming job creation of 517,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.",495
451,"In the Euro area, gas prices have fallen from peaks six months ago, and measures of economic sentiment are climbing back. Fourth-quarter real GDP growth came in at 0.4% (annualized). Germany, in contrast, saw a mild contraction. Accordingly, growth this year is poised to run at 1%, up from our forecast of -0.4% at the end of last year.   Central banks—Focused on Subduing Inflation  DM central banks are in the midst of a vigorous tightening cycle. The Federal Reserve over the past year has lifted rates by 450 basis points. Going forward, Citi expects 25 basis point rate increases at each of the Fed’s next three meetings.   Similarly, Citi Research expects the ECB to push the deposit rate to 3½%, its highest setting in two decades, and sees it holding that well into 2024, until inflation is clearly on its way back to the 2% target. In the UK, Australia, and Canada, policy has also tightened appreciably—and is likely to remain tight. The Bank of Japan remains an important outlier among the DM central banks, with its policy rate still in negative territory. For the EM economies, policy is historically tight among many in Latin America and some in emerging Europe. These central banks began their hiking cycles in 2021 and have remained aggressive, as they have faced domestic as well as global price pressures. In contrast, central banks in emerging Asia have been less vigorous, as domestic inflation has been more muted.   As DM central banks eventually pause their tightening, and global inflationary pressures ebb, the EM central banks where policy is particularly tight should have scope for rate cuts.

He is left handed, dyslexic and struggled with school which has given me a life-long appreciation for minorities. He rails against the “right-handed, linear, text based thinkers” who control our education system and make him “others” feel stupid! He started my volunteer work in his teens working with severely handicapped children. His father, Ivor Coats, told him of a story when he was prisoner of the Germans in 1945 that has greatly influenced him. His father, was in a parked train containing ill and badly wounded prisoners. He feared that overnight many prisoners would freeze to death so he, missing a foot, crawled in front of the train to demand blankets for the freezing prisoners. When a German soldier threatened to shoot him, he told the soldier that he was a British Officer and demanded to speak to a German Officer, who was summoned. Blankets were provided. His father’s message was that if you have rank or status use it for the least. In his early twenties a couple of high school friends died and my mother was severely ill. From these experiences I decided that life is too short to not make a difference everyday. At that time I started writing poetry as way of guiding what I do in life. I write poetry to know what I truly think and feel. In 1991 I moved to Boston. I have had career that spanned economic development, social investing, and non-profit management. From 2006 to 2018 I worked for an order of Episcopalian monks, the Society of Saint John the Evangelist, who have a monastery in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts.",488

545,"global insights securities services a world of opportunity evolving the digital asset ecosystem. A World of Opportunity: Evolving the Digital Asset EcosystemOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle06 May 2021A World of Opportunity: Evolving the Digital Asset EcosystemSecurities ServicesShareIncreasingly institutional investors are looking to invest in digital assets and create new opportunities for their clients. As digital assets become more mainstream, the investment ecosystem, from the front to back office, is rapidly evolving to adapt.  Ryan Marsh, Global head of DLT & digital innovation at Citi Securities Services, discusses how digital assets have the potential to transform investment processes within capital markets.  When we use the phrase ‘digital assets’, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often first come to mind, but how broad is this term in what it means for the future of capital markets? Digital assets refers to the technology that is used to secure the assets, so it is a broad term for any cryptographically-secured asset on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The main types include cryptocurrencies, CBDCs [central bank digital currencies], stable coins, security-backed tokens, asset-backed tokens and NFTs [non-fungible tokens]. Essentially, it is a basket of different asset classes secured by a common technology. A lot of the news we read is about cryptocurrencies, and if you look at the market cap of digital assets that’s where it currently lies. However over time, there will be a significant opportunity to digitally transform traditional assets where they could become more easily accessible to investors, and reduce costs associated with the investment lifecycle. Of these types of digital assets, where do you see the most potential in the capital markets in the short-term? If we look at the most liquid assets today, they are public securities such as equities and bonds that are supported by developed and regulated market infrastructure such as stock exchanges and central securities depositories (CSDs). That’s the space where we, as custodians traditionally service and where most of our transactional activity is. These securities are not only liquid but also relatively low cost to transact. Some might say that a T+2 settlement cycle is inefficient but it is significantly more efficient than transactions in alternative assets. Alternative assets such as private equity and real estate are generally paper-based and not as accessible, and certainly not serviced within those traditional infrastructures or timeframes.",483
546,"Take a piece of private equity or land that sits as a certificate or title deed in a vault somewhere for example – if we can digitize those and fractionalize them then that really does have the potential to democratize investments in these assets and increase liquidity. Those are the two paradigms that we have today. If we can start to digitize both these types of assets, then they not only become much more accessible, but we can also reduce the cost of the investment lifecycle as the investment lifecycle becomes shorter and more automated. Because of the minimum size of alternatives assets investments, however, lower value investors currently don’t have access to them, so that’s where we will see some early adoption. Whether it’s a bond, equity, piece of real estate or a cryptocurrency, once digitized, it can all be serviced in a common type of infrastructure whether that’s an exchange, CSD or a public peer to peer network. If it operates on DLT, it enables atomic, immutable and automated movement of assets that should reduce the cost of Investments. I believe cryptocurrency market cap is going to be overtaken fairly quickly by alternative assets and eventually securities as well. What does custody look like for digital assets? Think about what custody is in this context: it is the ability to safely manage and store private keys that control the assets. A digital asset is an asset secured by a cryptographic key, now that’s effectively a digital bearer instrument. The holder of that key has full control of the asset. Custody is the ability to safely store these cryptographic keys on behalf of the client. That’s clearly a big change from where we are today, but if you take a step back, this is really just a continuation of the evolution of custody. If you go back to pre- 1970s, custody was all about holding physical certificates in bank vaults for clients. Then it evolved to controlling immobilised assets in CSD accounts and then dematerialised assets in CSD accounts – now it’s about controlling the flow of assets across the internet by managing these digital keys. Custodians that can safely manage private keys can safekeep any asset, whether that’s cryptocurrency, securities, a piece of real estate or NFT. All those assets are going to be stored by similar processes for managing those keys. One of my predictions is that in 10 years’ time, a custodian will have a much wider range of assets in its possession, including things like NFTs.",499
547,"NFTs are a really interesting development – it’s an example of taking an asset that’s intangible in the past – such as a piece of intellectual property, like art  – digitising it and protecting it by cryptographically securing it with a key ensuring that it cannot be accessed or copied without access to the key. The capital markets of the future certainly sounds different through digitizing all sorts of products, how deep can it go? You can apply the logic to everything. There are conversations about how we as individuals are managing our identity for example. We have all this information on social media relating to you and you have little control over it and how it is used. There are initiatives underway such as the creation of a digital ID that you have full control over via a digital key and an entity can only access it when you allow them. In the future, even digital identities could be safekept by custodians. There’s a whole new world of asset classes that could emerge, so it’s a really exciting evolution. It’s not just about technical capabilities, because we need to have a way of safely managing those keys, but because everything is online, there also needs to be an increased focus on cyber security risk. We also need to know how these assets behave.  For example, if you look at crypto, there are processes like AirDrops  and staking that are unique to those assets. Different assets have their unique attributes and custodians have to deal with those as well as safely storing the keys and providing traditional services such as connectivity, credit, lending and market expertise. Are you engaging with clients on this evolution or is it more of a ‘build it and they will come’? Clients are interested and keen to partner on use cases and ultimately building solutions together. Traditionally, the service providers have been ahead of the investors in this space, but we are increasingly seeing this gap being closed. This is the future of custody and we are partnering closely with clients to provide access and reduce any barriers by ensuring that our solutions are backward compatible to minimize changes for our clients. What are these barriers for clients when it comes to this new digital asset ecosystem? There are three significant challenges: fragmentation, technical complexity and network adoption. With fragmentation, we are seeing a lot of new marketplaces emerging that will support different assets, standards and processes in those markets.",480
548,"So, you’ve got fragmentation of marketplaces, technologies and processes, and that can get quite overwhelming when actors are investing and servicing clients globally. With technical complexity, this space has evolved so quickly over 10 years. Two years ago, people were saying these networks can’t process more than 100 transactions per second, and now we are talking about networks that can support 60,000 transactions per second. The challenge is keeping up with the speed of this evolution and integrating this alongside legacy technology and processes that will remain relevant for a number of years. What we have quickly realised is that it is our job as a service provider to solve for these challenges, it shouldn’t be a barrier for our clients. Our goal is to ensure we build the necessary connections into these new marketplaces, adapt to those processes and the features of those new assets, and integrate all of these fragmented processes alongside our existing technology and processes. This way, clients will be able to access this new digital asset ecosystem via a single service layer and be assured of its compatibility with existing protocols. They won’t need to worry about connectivity or differing standards. We see this as a key differentiator of Citi’s service offering.

549,"global insights securities services artificial intelligence a game changer. Artificial Intelligence – A Game ChangerOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle07 Jun 2023Artificial Intelligence – A Game ChangerSecurities ServicesShareOnce the domain of science-fiction movies, artificial intelligence (AI) is now a fully-fledged reality. Its potential to transform countless industries should not be underestimated, with Microsoft founder Bill Gates describing recent developments in AI as being on a par with the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet and the mobile phone. To its proponents, AI could usher in all sorts of productivity gains across multiple sectors, with PwC predicting the technology will contribute an additional $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.1    Scott Ross, Head of NY Innovation Lab at Citi and Tod McKenna, Head of Data Science and AI for Securities Services at Citi, discuss how the technology could be applied in the world of finance.     ChatGPT is only the beginning   Right now, a number of financial institutions are looking for ways to leverage generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM) platform which has undergone exponential growth since first being released in November 2022. In the case of ChatGPT, it reportedly took just five days for the platform to amass one million unique users, versus 10 months for Facebook and 3.5 years for Netflix.   “ChatGPT is an LLM, which is trained to search and answer questions based on a “data set” – namely everything that has ever been published on the Internet. Like any machine trained with data, ChatGPT assumes the data is true, meaning the quality of the answers will be based on the quality of the data it receives. Although public data on the Internet can be of questionable quality, LLM solutions have the potential to be revolutionary,” said Ross.   Increasingly, LLM applications are being taught using specific and refined data sets, enabling them to become highly proficient in specialist industries, such as finance or law. Finchat.io is an example of one LLM that has been trained using publicly available financial data, including company filings and quarterly reports.   “The quality of this particular information is much better than what is available on the wider Internet. The Finchat.io tool can answer very detailed questions about the finances of a company.",493
550,"The next step will be for companies to introduce more of these vertically trained LLM tools across their different business lines. At Citi, we are actively investigating incorporating LLMs into all parts of our business including securities services,” said Ross.     How AI could revamp financial services   AI, including LLMs could play an instrumental role in expediting decision-making processes at financial institutions thereby generating efficiencies at a time when costs are trending upwards. “Whenever someone makes a decision, part of that process requires information gathering. AI helps users collect and synthesise information, before sending it onwards to the decision-maker”, noted McKenna.   Portfolio management is one area where LLMs and other AI tools could have a major impact. “A lot of the work in the front office involves investment teams or analysts poring over reports and filings when analysing companies. LLMs have the potential to circumvent a lot of that work,” said McKenna. Many of these AI solutions are arguably more accurate in terms of their analysis and predictions relative to human-generated forecasts. This is because they can review vast tranches of historical data and cross-reference it across multiple scenarios, in a way that is well beyond the capabilities of any human. “We have already observed that AI can do things like predict FX spot prices a half second in the future better than anything we have seen before. The same is true for things like complex portfolio optimization,” added Ross. Not only could LLMs streamline investment processes, but they may even help boost returns.   A number of operational activities are also being transformed by AI. AI has already been deployed extensively in risk management and compliance functions across financial institutions. “This is because AI is exceptional at detecting anomalous trends, which makes it an excellent tool to help firms combat money laundering and cyber-crime,” said Ross.   Within custody, AI can detect data quality problems, remedy issues with payments and eliminate manual touch points to improve reconciliations. Elsewhere, the technology has also been leveraged in collateral management, as it can provide forward looking predictions on price, risk and liquidity. At Citi, Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) has already been incorporated into some processes, including tax services.   AI is also being used for answering client enquiries. “We have an NLP [Natural Language Processing] tool which is trained to learn how to answer client enquiries or instructions sent via SWIFT MT599 messages.",489
551,"The engine can generate a response to clients, or it can initiate actions within our operations team,” said Mckenna.   Securities settlements is one area that could be ripe for disruption through AI. AI tools have already been adopted by custodians to predict if a trade will fail, allowing trading counterparties to remediate any problems during the transaction life-cycle. Although distributed ledger technology (DLT) could facilitate atomic or instantaneous settlement, experts argue that AI has the potential to supplement the process even further. “There is no doubt DLT will simplify the settlement process and make it more efficient. However, the DLT settlement process will still be a process reliant on data and some human intervention. This is the beauty of AI. Over time, and with enough data, AI can understand these processes and subsequently make recommendations on how to improve them,” continued Mckenna.     In the midst of an AI cultural revolution   As AI becomes more entrenched in people’s daily lives, firms will need to re-think their approach to talent management moving forward. According to a recent survey, 43% of college students said they have experience with AI tools like ChatGPT, of which half acknowledged they used them to work on assignments or exams.2 “Just as the digital natives grew up with Facebook and smartphones, there is now a new generation of young AI natives. This generation will be entering the workforce very shortly and will expect to use ChatGPT or some other variant in their work,” commented McKenna.   However, this is not the first time companies have been forced to adapt to meet the changing requirements of an increasingly tech-savvy workforce. “Years ago, we had a wave of young people come to work for the bank, and they were shocked that we did not have Internet. What is happening today with AI is broadly similar,” shared Ross. Businesses will eventually have to evolve to accommodate for the growing numbers of AI natives joining their ranks.     Taking a responsible approach   Although AI could unlock a number of potential benefits, the technology is not risk-free. Advances in AI should be undertaken responsibly, with guardrails being put in place to ensure the technology is developed in a safe and measured way.   “Responsible AI is a huge topic and we have a lot of people at Citi working on this very issue. Firstly, there needs to be transparency and explainability into the analytics and conclusions which AI is producing.",488
552,"This can sometimes be complicated as early AI technology is very much a black box. We also must be careful to ensure that AI does not display any bias in its modelling. This means we must have checks to prevent machines from making decisions that are biased,” said Ross.   Protections will also need to be implemented when using generative AI models, namely systems which continually learn and adapt to new situations. “Generative models, which learn on the fly, have to be monitored very closely for any drift,” added Ross. A prime example of so-called drift involved a major tech company’s AI -enabled chatbot, which posted inflammatory comments after being trolled on Twitter, having been programmed to learn from interactions with users on the social media site.   And finally, there are mounting concerns that AI will displace a number of jobs over the next few years, possibly leading to serious societal upheaval. Research by OpenAI suggests 80% of US employees could have up to 10% of their work affected by GPTs.3 Consequentially, this has prompted some regulators – including those in the EU – to propose rules on AI and how it is used. The EU’s AI Act, for example, will attempt to implement stronger rules around data quality, transparency, human oversight and accountability,4 and other global regulators will likely follow suit. As such, financial institutions will need to think carefully about how they implement AI.      Harnessing AI for the future   AI is developing at an unprecedented pace, and its impact is likely to be felt extensively across a wide gamut of industries. Financial services will need to adapt to navigate these changes too, including embracing a new generation of AI natives and building guardrails to mitigate some of the risks which this new technology could pose.   Given the speed at which AI is developing, a wait and see policy is not viable. A successful AI strategy will require companies not just to adopt the technology itself, but to do so in a way that puts risk management and compliance at the forefront. A number of financial institutions are adopting this approach and leveraging AI in areas such as risk management, client onboarding, client servicing, collateral management, payments and improving data quality.              1.

554,"global insights securities services creating a resilient future in latin america. Creating a Resilient Future in Latin AmericaOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle07 Aug 2023Creating a Resilient Future in Latin AmericaSecurities ServicesShareLATAM markets may be facing some challenging macro headwinds, but this has not deterred them from being ambitious. Several countries in the region have been pushing ahead with sweeping market reforms — including adopting T+1 for equity trade settlements, integrating new technologies into post-trade processes and working on ways to consolidate their national stock exchanges.Citi Securities Services facilitated a discussion with senior executives from the stock exchanges of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico to talk about how these industry changes are transforming LATAM’s capital markets.   Aligning with the US’s T+1 transition The US transition to T+1 is expected to have major repercussions for financial institutions across LATAM mainly because the region’s equity markets are heavily intertwined with those in the US — and none more so than Mexico’s. “T+1 is very relevant for us in Mexico as approximately 50% of what is traded on the exchange in Mexico is related to foreign securities. As for domestic Mexican stocks, it is estimated that foreign investors generate approximately 70% of the trading volume. We are aligning ourselves with the US just as we did when T+2 went live in 2017 and will be adopting T+1 simultaneously with the US,” shared Roberto Gonzalez Barrera, CEO, Post-Trade Division at Grupo Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV Group). Other LATAM markets appear to be taking a more cautious approach towards T+1. Although there are working groups in Brazil exploring the merits of T+1, Daniel Demattio, Managing Director, Clearing and Settlement, B3 doubted there would be any substantive changes within the next two years. Meanwhile, Colombia is in the process of understanding the impact a shift to T+1 would have on participants and especially on foreign investors, to assess the right timing for the shift. Although the case for T+1 is compelling (i.e. less counterparty and settlement duration risk, capital optimisation, better liquidity, etc.), its implementation is expected to be quite challenging. Settlement mismatches between securities trading in T+1 and T+2 markets could potentially create problems for LATAM providers. “Securities settling in Mexico, the US and Canada will do so on T+1.",499
555,"Of the 50% of foreign securities settling in Mexico, around 70% relate to US ETFs [exchange traded funds] and securities, and the rest are in Europe, which will continue to settle on T+2. Settling in different cycles will be a challenge for local broker dealers,” said Gonzalez. “On the other hand, when executing local stock for foreign investors, local brokers will need to send confirmations — once trades are completed — to either the US broker dealer or the foreign investor, and this then needs to be disseminated onwards to the global and local sub-custodians, so that the trade can settle on the next day. This could be quite complicated. Similarly, we expect there will be FX issues too,” said Gonzalez. T+1 is also likely to impact other activities, including allocations and affirmations, corporate actions and securities lending. With less time to settle, there are fears T+1 may even result in an increase in the number of trade fails, leading to firms facing more frequent cash penalties or even higher Basel III risk weighted capital requirements. Beneficial owner markets — including Brazil, Colombia and Peru — could also encounter difficulties should they decide to implement T+1. “In Colombia and Peru — which are final beneficiary markets — we need to know who the final investor is before we can settle a trade. Losing an entire day from the settlement process will inevitably make an existing difficult situation even more challenging,” explained Juan Pablo Cordoba, CEO at Colombia Stock Exchange. In order to handle the shift towards T+1 successfully, financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and other intermediary providers in LATAM will need to invest into new technologies and automation. Already, there is talk about compressing the settlement cycle even further — either to T+0, or even atomic settlement, which is when there is an instantaneous exchange of assets by two trading counterparties. If used alongside distributed ledgers, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)- or digital fiat money backed by Central Banks — could help markets achieve atomic settlement. A handful of LATAM markets — most notably Brazil — are already conducting proofs of concepts (POCs) into the viability of CBDCs. “The Central Bank has been very focused on digital currencies, having established a working group in 2020, and is also exploring whether permissioned networks could be used to issue tokenised securities, starting with government bonds.",488
556,"The idea is they will be able to facilitate DVP [delivery versus payment] on the network between CBDCs and tokenised securities,” said Demattio. Evolving with the times As markets continue to undergo rapid transformation, FMIs in LATAM are quickly adapting in various ways — by giving investors easier access to a wider range of asset classes, and by improving their own operational processes. For example, in order to attract more trading volumes, Gonzalez shared that Mexico’s Central Bank is looking to permit electronic trading of government bonds, an asset class where transactions have historically been carried out on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis. “We are building a Central Counterparty Clearing House [CCP] for bonds, and this should be ready later this year, with electronic trading due to begin in the first quarter of 2024,” said Gonzalez. As FMIs look to enhance their operational capabilities, many are starting to leverage cloud-based technologies, noted Demattio. Not only does cloud technology enable financial institutions to obtain scalability, but it can also help them net cost synergies, improve their operational resilience and enhance their data management capabilities. “The movement to cloud-based systems is comparable to when many downsized from mainframes to smaller platforms. We are already seeing more market infrastructures such as CSDs [Central Securities Depositories] moving towards cloud architecture,” said Demattio. FMIs in LATAM also acknowledge the role that fin-tech providers could play in the innovation process. “We recognise we need to be swift and agile when innovating and this is where fin-techs come into play. On some of our more peripheral services, we are partnering with fin-techs as they end up being more cost efficient and offer a quicker time to market,” said Cordoba. Exchange consolidation gathers momentum Efforts to facilitate easier cross-border investment, trading, listing, clearing and settlement across LATAM are ongoing. Although previous attempts to integrate the local markets have not succeeded, experts believe the latest initiative — which would see the stock exchanges of Colombia, Chile and Peru consolidate into a single regional holding company — could just work. Under this scheme, Colombia Stock Exchange and Santiago Stock Exchange will each control 40% of the holding company, with Lima Stock Exchange owning the remaining 20%.",460
557,"Local FMIs believe this scheme — assuming it goes to plan — could help draw in more foreign capital and encourage greater investment by domestic institutions, thereby providing a useful boost to market liquidity across the three countries. “The main objective is to make the market as attractive as possible — not just to participants inside the region, but globally. If you are an issuer, you can list in one country but your shares can be traded in all three markets. With trading, there will be a single rule book and single matching engine for investors across the three markets. We also hope that one day there will be a single CCP covering all three markets. CSDs will remain local, but there will be interconnectedness between them. And finally, there will be a single market data feed for investors too,” commented Cordoba. While this integration is likely to initially benefit equities, it could be extended to other asset classes as well, including listed derivatives. Nonetheless, Cordoba cautioned that fixed income may take time as it continues to be traded mostly on an OTC basis and trading practices differ between countries. This is not the first time, however, that LATAM economies have attempted to integrate their capital markets. In 2011, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru announced they would harmonise their respective markets under the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA) scheme. Although MILA had plenty of buy in from the local exchanges, arbitraging regulations and tax requirements together with the absence of a shared currency in the participatory markets ultimately resulted in limited trading volumes. The most recent initiative attempts to learn from some of the mistakes that plagued MILA. “MILA enabled trading across different markets, but it did not take into account the importance of post-trade,” said Cordoba. By this, FMIs– including CSDs and CCPs — in the participatory markets operated very much independently of each other. “Now we have a single holding company which will own all of the exchanges, CSDs and CCPs which means that the strategy and decision-making is all taking place in a single location,” Cordoba added. This new structure will help ensure there is full interconnectedness between each of the different FMIs, which should make it easier for regional market integration to succeed. Gearing up for the future Across LATAM, FMIs are gearing up for the future in a variety of ways — from introducing T+1 and adopting new asset classes to harmonising regional capital markets.",496

559,"global insights securities services distributed ledger technology time to shine. Distributed Ledger Technology: Time to ShineOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle25 Jan 2021Distributed Ledger Technology: Time to ShineSecurities ServicesShareAfter a slow start, DLT may finally be ready to transform the post-trade environment.   When Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) was first revealed to the world, many within the securities services industry believed that this could be the solution to a number of challenges. With banks attempting to reduce their operating costs and eliminate inefficiencies across post-trade, DLT was widely viewed as being something of a remedy. Although the technology’s capabilities were initially over-hyped, major banks and Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) have since become increasingly targeted and pragmatic in how they apply DLT when looking to solve their real-world challenges. However, market participants also recognize that the absence of proper global standards is delaying critical mass adoption. DLT Opens Up New Asset Classes DLT is currently being trested at a number of FMIs to help them support the trading and settlement of digital assets such as security tokens. In the case of security tokens, industry experts believe the digitalization of difficult-to-trade assets in private markets, such as real estate or fine wine will help generate deeper liquidity by optimizing the investment process. Beyond FMIs, a number of central banks are looking to leverage DLT as they explore the development of central bank digital currencies. Elsewhere, there are a series of initiatives focussed on the creation and maintenance of StableCoins, which are crypto-currencies pegged to fiat money or other assets such as government bonds. For many, digital assets are where the custody industry’s future lies. “We believe custodians will be supporting a number of new and different asset classes in the future. This is going to force the industry to evolve, and further develop their technology capabilities,” said Ryan Marsh, Global Head of Distributed Ledger Technology & Digital Innovation at Citi Securities Services. Tangible progress has been made across a number of markets in regards to DLT and digital asset adoption. In Switzerland, the Six Digital Exchange, which is operated by SIX, the country’s primary stock exchange group, is building a fully integrated issuance, trading, settlement and custody infrastructure for digital assets. Singapore has also made impressive inroads with its DLT and digital asset development.",483
560,"In 2018, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) together with the Monetary Authority of Singapore successfully tested DLT to provide delivery versus payment settlement for digital assets as part of its Project Ubin initiative. More recently, SGX used its DLT-enabled digital asset issuance platform to issue its first-ever digital bond. Meanwhile, the Australian Securities Exchange is looking to replace its equities clearing and settlement system with DLT, although launch has been delayed to 2023. Increasingly, the technology is being used to establish new regulated FMIs, such as BondEvalue in Singapore and Archax in the UK, as firms look to take advantage of the growing investor interest in digital assets and processes. Driving Operational Efficiencies DLT may help bring about a number of operational advantages too. “One of the principal benefits of DLT is that it can significantly improve the way in which data is used within an ecosystem. Technology such as shared ledgers can ensure that golden source data is disseminated and distributed along value chains in a controlled and permissioned manner. The expectation is that this will increase the speed and integrity of data, synchronize activities and remove duplication and reconciliation, which not only improves efficiency but also reduces risk,” says Marsh. Enhancements to data distribution can also facilitate instantaneous trading and settlement, potentially helping to reduce intermediation, further increase efficiency, and drive down industry costs. This was illustrated by a recent Citi survey at The Network Forum Autumn Meeting, which revealed that 31% of respondents believed the biggest advantage of digital assets would be a more efficient post-trade settlement process, followed closely by access to new asset classes. “In markets with immediate trading and settlement, the role of clearing could disappear meaning there may no longer be a need for a central counter-party clearing house. As DLT provides a single source of truth, all market participants will be working from the same data sets thereby reducing the number of messages exchanged between counterparties and diminishing the need for reconciliations,” says Nadine Teychenne, Director of Custody Distributed Ledger Technology and Digital Assets Product Development at Citi Securities Services.",423
561,"“By having a single source of irrevocable truth between all parties to a trade, the likelihood of mistakes or errors being made during the transactional lifecycle may recede, and with it, so will risk.” The availability of a single source of truth will also have a significant impact on other post-trade asset servicing activities such as corporate action processing, which have historically been higher risk and involve manual intervention, creating added costs and inefficiencies in the transactional lifecycle. While COVID-19 has led to some progress around digitalization such as the removal of physical signatures, a renewed uptick in e-voting, virtual Annual General Meetings in various markets, many experts believe the adoption of DLT will help eliminate a number of the pain-points and risks synonymous with post-trade processing. Overcoming the Barriers to Adoption There are a number of operational challenges with the technology itself and some of the new processes that will be supported by it. Immediate atomic trading and settlement is one such example. “Immediate settlement can cause problems. At the moment, market participants settle on T+2 but a shift to immediate atomic trading and settlement would force counterparties to pre-fund their transactions creating liquidity problems. It is possible custodians could provide credit lines in order to solve this problem,” says Marsh. Moreover, simply layering DLT  onto existing mainframe technology is not viable either and could actually exacerbate operational risk. As a result, integrating DLT into legacy systems will need to be carried out carefully. Most significantly, DLT adoption rates will stay subdued unless standards are created. “Our industry is very mature and has spent a great deal of time defining standards around operational processes and financial messaging. The issue with DLT is that there is a significant lack of standards meaning several different types of DLT protocols and associated processes have emerged,” notes Marsh. In the absence of any common standards, the progress of interoperability solutions between different financial DLT systems will be impacted. “More broadly, as highlighted in our recent survey, other challenges facing DLT include a lack of established markets and internal technology investment. These will need to be overcome before we will see wider adoption of DLT in this space,” adds Teychenne. Progress So Far Regulators have largely been receptive to DLT. For example, the European Commission’s  recently published Digital Finance Package contains proposals outlining a pilot scheme for FMIs looking to incorporate DLT into their operating models.",496

576,"global insights securities services navigating the march towards t 1. Navigating The March Towards T+1OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle15 Jun 2022Navigating The March Towards T+1Securities ServicesShareDownloadSince the US and Canada announced that they will transition from a T+2 settlement cycle to T+1 in 2024, some within the industry are already busy petitioning for T+0 to be considered. While settlement compression could unlock a number of strategic and operational benefits for market participants, its implementation carries significant risks, which need to be overcome.Michele Pitts, Head of Securities Services, United States, and Head of US Custody Product Management at Citi, sits down with our Head of Securities Services for Canada and senior representatives from DTCC and BlackRock to discuss how financial institutions are bracing themselves for the roll-out of T+1.     Engineering market-wide efficiencies through T+1 By removing one day from the existing trade settlement window, market participants will most likely obtain major risk benefits, which in turn will expedite operational and cost synergies. As highlighted in “Accelerating the US Securities Settlement Cycle to T+1” — a shorter rolling settlement cycle will mean firms incur reduced systemic, operational and counterparty risk during the trade settlement process, something which could prove vitally important during bouts of volatility. This sentiment was also echoed in Citi’s Securities Services Evolution whitepaper where 44% of market participants surveyed regarded greater efficiency in the investment and trading process as being the most important benefit of faster settlements for their organisation.   These scaled back risk exposures will mean trading counterparties are subject to lower margin requirements, facilitating cash optimisation.1 “With one less day in the settlement cycle, there can be a more efficient deployment of capital and a reduction in risk, which is a benefit to our end clients,” says Lou Rosato, Director, Global Investment Operations at BlackRock.   T+1 adoption will also force intermediaries (i.e. custodians) to modernise parts of their antiquated technology infrastructure and legacy systems, in what could potentially negate many of the pain-points synonymous with today’s settlement activities — further crystallising some of the efficiency gains made already. “A lot of post-trade processes are still reliant on manual intervention. Settlement compression will force the industry to strengthen and automate many of these processes,” says Martin Palivec, Head of Securities Services, Canada, Citi.",501
577,"  “Reporting is a key area where marked improvements are needed especially as we are facing greater pressure from clients about the timeliness and accuracy of reporting. Moving forward, we need to be able to inform clients about their trade statuses and instructions almost immediately, and this is something that cannot be handled manually,” continues Palivec.   Barriers to change However, the implementation of T+1 is likely to cause logistical challenges. John Abel, Executive Director of Clearance and Settlement, Product Management at the DTCC notes that settlement compression will force members to examine existing trade allocation, affirmation and confirmation procedures.   The Industry Steering Committee (ISC) is recommending that allocations take place no later than 7pm ET on trade date so that firms have adequate time to process affirmations by 9pm ET on T, having previously occurred at 1130 AM ET on T+1.2   “All firms involved in the institutional trade lifecycle will  be impacted by the move to T+1. A lot must happen in the institutional trades flow to meet the new processing cutoffs. Allocations, affirmations and confirmations need to occur in a new compressed time-frame. This is an area that certainly warrants attention,” says Abel.   The ISC warns a side-effect of T+0 could be a reduction in the number of trades which settle on time on the National Securities Clearing Corporation’s (NSCC) Continuous Net Settlement system.3 Again, this could lead to a spike in trade settlement fails. To mitigate this risk, Pitts points out that greater investment into technology and automation  will be vital to ensuring that these processes can all function seamlessly within the condensed time-frame.   Other impediments also need redressing. For example, 31% of market participants surveyed in Citi’s Securities Services Evolution whitepaper viewed funding as potentially the greatest obstacle/challenge for any reduction in settlement, both in general and specifically for their own organisation.   Abel also cautions that non-US investors operating in different time-zones could face challenges because of the shorter settlement cycle, citing FX management as an area raised by some in the industry. “While removing a day from the FX cycle is challenging, many non-US investors already participate in other US markets that currently settle T+1, e.g., fixed income. Members should review their processes for supporting FX related to these transactions to see if they are scalable for US equity volumes,” says Abel.",486
578,"  Learning from other experiences Outside of the US and Canada, India started phasing in T+1 in February 2022 for listed securities — beginning first with the smallest companies by market capitalisation. However, it appears North American markets are unlikely to adopt the incremental approach to T+1 being taken in India. “India has phased in a T+1 settlement cycle, but this staggered implementation is not feasible in the North American markets,” highlights Pitts.   “When we moved to T+2 from T+3, the industry discussed whether it should implement an incremental transition to T+2, e.g., by different asset class. This would have entailed moving equities to T+2 followed by fixed income, for example. At the end of the day, we concluded that most of these assets run on a single platform so carving out and identifying which securities would be T+2 versus T+3 created more risk than it was worth. As such, we are favouring a big bang approach to T+1,” explains Abel.   Patience will also be essential if the move to T+1 is to be judged a success. Although the US industry has pencilled in March 2024 as T+1’s go live date, the DTCC together with industry bodies including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and Investment Company Institute (ICI) have urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delay the introduction of any settlement changes until Labour Day. “This will enable the Canadian market to take advantage of the three-day weekend in the US to implement T+1. We are waiting for the SEC to come back to us with their comments,” says Abel.   Ultimately, the industry needs to work together to ensure that T+1’s integration is straightforward. “The industry needs to collaborate and facilitate interoperability of systems, whether it is FIX, SWIFT or any other proprietary systems,” says Rosato.   Expediting settlements through innovation With the US and Canada on the cusp of T+1, some believe the imposition of T+0 is an inevitable next step, highlighting it will lead to further improvements in capital optimisation and risk management. There is also a general acceptance that T+0 will only be possible if new disruptive technologies are assimilated into the post-trade operating model. “It is hard to imagine T+0 working efficiently without DLT [distributed ledger technology].",493
579,"In today’s existing set-up with all of the various rules and processes, it will be challenging for T+0 to be effective,” says Palivec.   This is echoed in the ISC report, which notes T+0’s introduction would require a complete restructuring of the clearance and settlement model; revisions to regulatory frameworks and the implementation of real-time currency movements. The report continues that the costs of adopting new technologies would be disproportionately shouldered by smaller or medium sized firms who are reliant on legacy systems.4   However, market infrastructures are already scoping out ways to enhance their existing settlement processes. As part of its Project Ion initiative, the DTCC is, for instance, trialling DLT to support T+1 and T+0 settlement. In June 2022, the DTCC will make the Project Ion platform available to select clients — in parallel to its existing settlement system.    The DTCC’s Abel takes a nuanced approach on the merits of T+0. “A lot of people say that new technology is the answer to T+1 and T+0 but most of the impediments are not technology issues, but process problems which the industry has created for itself. Our feeling is that moving the entire industry to a standard T+0 settlement cycle will be challenging for the industry and that the industry would likely want to conduct a comprehensive cost benefit analysis on whether such a move is viable. That said, there is an opportunity in the US market for voluntary T+0 trading platforms to evolve and DTCC wants to ensure this activity can be supported,” says Abel.     Bring on 2024 Shortening the settlement cycle will yield a number of benefits for market participants, but it could also put strain on FX management together with the allocation, affirmation and confirmation processes. “Even though T+1 is not yet live in the US or Canada, some are lobbying for the enactment of T+0. Again, this is easier said than done, especially as it would require a comprehensive overhaul of countless post-trade procedures,” says Pitts.   Although 2024 may sound like a long way away, in reality it is not. A lot of high-level and significant operational changes need to be made in North America’s markets before T+1, let alone T+0 can be delivered.",464

582,"global insights securities services securities services evolution 2022. Securities Services Evolution 2022OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle02 Nov 2022Securities Services Evolution 2022Disruption and transformation in financial market infrastructuresSecurities ServicesShareDownloadChange is clearly underway with a greater sense of momentum and purpose in all developments across the industry. The detailed findings of our report were only possible thanks to the valued participation of the 12 financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and almost 300 market participants globally.Last year’s Citi Securities Services Evolution 2021 whitepaper saw global securities markets on the brink of transformation. This year, this transformation appears already underway, as witnessed by important settlement cycle reductions in major markets, plus a host of initiatives in related processes and technologies. However, there is also evidence that financial market infrastructures (FMIs) are developing and testing new technologies/processes in anticipation of change, rather than due to immediate demand. All this effort and investment is being heavily influenced by the same three trends identified last year as beingtransformational forces for change in the post-trade environment:   Settlement compression Settlement compression has again been a high profile theme this year, with the US and its most closely-linked markets moving to T+1, plus the decision by India to embark upon the same journey. This has also been accompanied by a greater sense of purpose among FMIs, with several engaging in compression or digitalization projects for specific asset types, such as commercial paper or bonds. In addition, several traditional FMIs are working on pilots or proofs of concept in support of future compression, while several non-traditional FMIs are already capable of T+0 settlement. At the same time, market participants increasingly believe that shorter settlement cycles are the forthcoming reality, with 51% now thinking T+1 will be the prevailing equity settlement cycle by 2026. 85% also expect settlement to be at T+1, T+0 or atomic over the same timeframe, versus 78% last year.   Digitalization Digital assets have continued to grow rapidly in importance since last year, as witnessed by a recent executive order1 to establish a national policy for them. Elsewhere, various polls 2,3,4 have underlined how seriously professional asset managers are now taking them as an asset class.",475
583,"This trend corresponds with the high levels of digital asset activity among market participants polled this year and the number of FMIs already live with (or working on) digital asset initiatives, tokenization and fractionalization. On the matter of tokenization, both market participants and FMIs view it as likely to assist in adding market liquidity, though FMIs mostly see this relating mainly to illiquid asset classes, such as real estate. They were also somewhat skeptical about the value of digitizing existing assets, other than as an intermediate step towards native digital assets, in order to avoid having to run parallel systems and reconcile between them. This was linked to FMIs’ concerns (also raised last year) that there needed to be robust regulation and legal infrastructure to support the evolution of native digital assets. Sentiment from the FMIs is that there is room for improvement, with most digital assets still being created by tokenizing existing physical assets. Additionally, FMIs also felt that greater international collaboration was therefore needed to support natively digital assets and also to reduce the risk of digital islands being created that would cause legal and standards inconsistency across jurisdictions.   Technology and digital transformation The pace of technology development and adoption in support of the settlement process continues to accelerate. The past year has seen a slew of announcements, including the creation of a regulatory sandbox5 for distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based trading/settlement, several FMIs taking stakes in DLT fintechs and numerous DLT industry trials and pilots. Nevertheless, there remains a dichotomy between market participants and FMIs on the subject of DLT. 21% of market participants see it as core to a successful transition to T+1/T+0 and 25% expect a DLT based market infrastructure to cut post-trade processing costs by 31-50% or more. By contrast, traditional FMIs are more cautious. Despite their high levels of DLT activity, most are still dubious about its suitability for mainstream securities settlement and none felt that cost savings were more than conjectural at this stage. The overall picture revealed by FMIs and market participants is even more positive than last year. On several points — such as the use of DLT — there is closer accord between the two groups, but there is also an even greater sense of purpose and active preparation. Ultimately, the industry appears increasingly cohesive and prepared to invest the time and effort to further improve the settlement experience across a growing number of asset types.",491

Not only is the industry preparing to remove an entire day from the settlement cycles of the world’s largest capital market, but firms are also readying themselves for what they expect to be imminent changes to other settlement cycles, digital currency adoption and even atomic settlement in the next five years.     The central theme of this year’s whitepaper revolves around the volume and diversity of change that market participants are facing around the world. This change centers on three broad areas:   FMI transformation: Significant change pressures being felt by financial market infrastructures across the world to manage a growth agenda during a phase of major technological transition (and removal of legacy platforms). Settlement transformation: Preparations by all profiles of global market participants for accelerated settlements in the US and Canada (transitioning in May 2024) and more to follow — giving rise to a new, real-time target operating model. Digital assets and DLT: Adoption and live deployment of digital assets (including crypto-currencies) as well as tokenization projects (digitizing traditional securities), building on the increased optionality that DLT offers each firm.   The FMI agenda Across the world, FMIs (most notably the Central Securities Depositories, or CSDs) are almost all facing the same two headline challenges: How to accelerate ransformation and innovation (in settlements and digital assets above all) while at the same time managing a transition away from ageing, legacy infrastructures. Across digitization, accelerated settlements and legacy transition, the ecosystem impacts of these pressures are now top-of-mind for many FMIs, as they shift their historical focus from managing (their own) platforms towards managing a wider ecosystem. From owning individual change to facilitating change across the industry.   While FMIs struggle with these challenges almost uniformly, almost regardless of location, there are important differences.",477
585,"In Latin America, we are about to see one of the most ambitious consolidation projects ever realized between Colombia, Peru and Chile. In Europe, the lasting benefits of clearing competition are now coming into question. In the digitization space, those in Asia and Latin America continue to innovate to drive financial market participation — while their peers in North America and Europe are shifting their focus towards the provision of common industry platforms. In Europe, Australia and other markets, corporate action standards continue to be a focus.   Faced with what seems to be an inevitable acceleration in settlement cycles (coming to the US, Canada and most likely Mexico in 2024), FMIs look set to have an increasingly complex operating agenda for years to come.   Settlement transformation     89% of our survey respondents expect their local settlement cycles to shorten to T+0 or T+1 within the next five years. This means a vast amount of change ahead for an extended period. As firms across the world are discovering with their preparations to T+1 settlement cycles in the US and Canada next year, the impacts of accelerated settlement are profound and touch everything from trade fails to headcounts and treasury requirements. Next year’s transition will impact up to eight different departments in each organization but in differing ways, depending most of all on where firms are located in the world. Those in Europe and Asia will be profoundly impacted by the treasury implications of T+1, while those in North America contend with regulatory requirements and securities lending liquidity.   With each market transition, the industry’s best-practice sharpens a little. After India’s T+1 move in early 2023,  the path towards market readiness is clear: First get clients and counterparties engaged; then drive internal automation; and finally put in place resources and location strategies. Across all of these areas, the ability to depend on real-time communications, feeding a realtime view of inventory is increasingly critical.   With each market move increasing dislocation risks between different global settlement cycles, the likelihood of the T+1 domino effect continuing is high.    DLT and digital assets  2023 sees 74% of our respondents engaging in distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital asset initiatives (increased from 47% in 2022), in a clear sign that the DLT momentum continues to grow, despite negative news headlines around FTX and other initiatives.",481
586,"But while digital asset and crypto-currency activity continues (notably in Europe and Asia), building and preparation activity seems increasingly focused on DLT and tokenization, as the industry looks to leverage the choice and flexibility that the technology offers in operating processes and market rules.     As this increased activity moves into live environments, the dependencies that lie ahead are becoming more granular. In need of a currency leg for digitized transactions, the industry is increasingly bullish on their expectations of digital cash being operational within five years (through a range of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and more commercial mechanisms).1 Organizationally, the focus is increasingly on those whose role it is to govern our infrastructures — not just regulators but also risk, compliance and finance teams. Technologically, there has also been a marked shift in who is expected to manage the burden of legacy platform connectivity — from the market participant to the provider. And lastly, but not least importantly, financial markets regulators across the globe are sharpening their guidelines and legislations to ensure continued oversight on market integrity and investor protection.   Looking ahead, the continued momentum of DLT and digital assets looks set to depend on two factors. First is the sell-side’s ability to successfully engage the buyside, using a narrative that is built around the needs of a portfolio manager (more than an operations head today). Second is the ability to change industry processes to realize the benefits that DLT offers.     1 https://icg.citi.com/icghome/what-we-think/citigps/insights/money-tokens-and-games Click here to view the report in full.UP NEXTArticleCreating a Resilient Future in Latin AmericaSecurities ServicesArticleT+1: The CountdownSecurities ServicesArticleSecurities Services Evolution 2022Securities ServicesLearn more about Securities Services at Citi or contact us* First name* Last name* Company name* Email addressTitleCountry* CommentsPlease do not share personal or account information in your comments submission.I'd like Citi's insights delivered directly to my inbox.You can unsubscribe at any time.Choose area(s) of interestSelectRead Citigroup Privacy NoticesSubmitCancelSubscribeSign up to receive our newsletter providing a roundup of recent content and updates on new reports.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",500

Securities Services Evolution 2021OKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle08 Oct 2021Securities Services Evolution 2021Securities ServicesShareDownloadDisruption and transformation in financial market infrastructures The securities industry is on the brink of transformational change. New technologies and digitization look set to usher in not just greater consistency and efficiency, but also completely new asset types and trading opportunities. This in turn calls for greater collaboration among market participants, regulators and FMIs which will ultimately streamline processes and mitigate potential risks.   This whitepaper is based upon data gathered from both financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and other market participants across Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and Latin America. The geographic breadth and broad spectrum of firms that participated has helped generate quantitative and qualitative insights into ongoing developments across the securities markets ecosystem.     FMIs A total of 15 leading FMIs (12 traditional, 3 non-traditional) participated in one-on-one in depth interviews which took place between 28 July and August 19 2021. Traditional FMIs interviewed included exchanges, centralized securities depositories and clearing houses. Non-traditional FMIs interviewed included a digital exchange, a digital asset custodian and a fintech.   Market participants In order to gauge the sentiment of market participants across the industry, Citi Securities Services collaborated with Global Custodian to survey almost 400 individuals around the globe via an online poll that ran between 3 August and 1 September 2021. These included, among others, a broad mix of custodians, banks, broker dealers, asset managers and institutional investors   Executive Summary The global securities landscape is on the verge of transformation, with new technologies and digitalization efforts poised to deliver major efficiencies and potential savings. This represents a radical change for an industry historically fragmented in terms of technology, operating models and process inconsistencies. The periodic volatility and remote working caused by the pandemic have been a catalyst for this change.   The pandemic has also highlighted the need for market participants, regulators and financial market infrastructures (FMIs)to co-operate on key initiatives, such as digitization and  digitalization.1 Appetite for both is clearly increasing as their potential to transform the industry becomes more widely acknowledged by market participants and FMIs alike.   In the early days of the pandemic, high market volatility and volume underlined the critical role that FMIs and securities services providers play.",501
588,"The focus now is on how increased automation can deliver even greater resilience and efficiency, while simultaneously reducing risks and costs.   Settlement compression Against this backdrop, settlement compression has once again become an important consideration for all involved, along with the associated trends of digital assets, technology and digital transformation. All these are now attracting attention and investment from the FMIs interviewed for this paper, as well as considerable interest from the market participants surveyed. The forthcoming shortening of the US settlement cycle to T+1 is one reason for this growing interest, recent periods of high volatility another. FMIs see the major benefit of reducing settlement cycles as risk reduction, which will in turn enable lower margin requirements and the release of capital that can be more efficiently deployed elsewhere. For example, most FMIs felt that some of this capital could be used to fund more trading activity, thus driving better liquidity. However, while most FMIs felt that these gains would apply to T+1, they would not apply to T+0 or atomic settlement because of the loss of netting benefits and the need to fund gross settlement. Although this is clearly an area of growing interest, there has not been much pressure from market participants to shorten settlement cycles, though this will probably change as nearly half of the market participants surveyed expect T+1 to arrive within the next five years.   When they transitioned from T+3 to T+2, some FMIs invested in technology that would allow them to handle any future shortening of the settlement cycle. As such, they did not view technology as a barrier for settlement compression, whereas almost 50% of market participants indicated that upgrading legacy technology would be key. Instead, FMIs felt that business process efficiency and the alignment of processes among participants posed far greater challenges, noting that these had also been demanding during the previous transition.   Other topics discussed included the duration of operating hours and alignment with cash settlement systems. Neither FMIs nor market participants saw these as potential roadblocks to settlement compression and some FMIs have already instituted additional intraday settlement cycles to preclude any such issues. However, several Asian FMIs observed that time zone differences might make it difficult for US and European investors to source FX cost-effectively.   Digitalization The biggest opportunities to transform our industry however, lie in digitization, digitalization and digital transformation.",468
589,"The market is responding in various ways: market participants and FMIs are actively participating or exploring use cases in digital assets, distributed ledger technology (DLT), digital asset initiatives,2 tokenization and fractionalization. In the case of FMIs, these were primarily for traditional assets, but they stressed the wider possibilities of using digital assets for less liquid markets, such as real estate or art.   The appropriate legal and regulatory infrastructure was also seen as absolutely critical to the success of digital assets, not just on a per country basis but also collaboratively and ultimately globally. Without this, many of the potential benefits and efficiencies could be lost. This view on regulation also applied to the success of atomic settlement, particularly in the context of creating a global settlement layer that would support all asset types with fungibility. On the future use of atomic settlement, both FMIs and market participants were positive, with market participants slightly more optimistic on the timeline to production.   As the industry responds to these changing dynamics, it must do so in a way that does not compromise existing services. The ability to service both ‘old’ and ‘new’ assets will be essential. In the short term, most FMIs favored separation between their existing and any new infrastructures for traditional and digital assets, while acknowledging that integration was probably ideal in the longer term.   Technology and digital transformation The FMIs interviewed were also pragmatic about how DLT could be applied to solve their real-world challenges. While a DLT-based market infrastructure was viewed positively by both FMIs and market participants in terms of efficiency and cost reduction, the FMIs were less convinced that DLT was key to shorter settlement cycles. They also saw DLT as being a challenging technology to implement, partly due to a lack of large-scale precedent in traditional markets and partly as a result of the absence of a dominant set of common standards. Other technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are already being deployed by FMIs for market surveillance activities or to gain internal efficiencies. There is further potential for both technologies, especially in conjunction with DLT, in areas such as reducing settlement fails and risk-adjusted trade pricing.   It is clear that new technologies are redefining the future of post-trade but this evolution will not take place overnight. The insights from this whitepaper reveal a post-trade environment that is complex and full of innovation and activity.",482
590,"global insights securities services t 1 a race against time. T+1 — A race against timeOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle24 Mar 2023T+1 — A race against timeSecurities ServicesShareDownload In February 2023, the SEC confirmed that T+1 would go live on May 28, 2024. The implementation of T+1 could potentially be quite complicated, as it will force market participants into making material adjustments to their existing operating models and underlying technology systems. With T+1’s deadline rapidly approaching in the US, the window for preparations is getting narrower.Industry preparations reveal a growing chasm   With the implementation date now finalized, market participant firms are actively working towards readiness though the levels of preparation among financial institutions appears to be quite varied. “The move to a T+1 settlement cycle has been an ongoing industry effort for more than two years now. However, we still see people in different pockets, namely those who are very prepared and ahead of the game, versus those who are much further behind, and are not yet thinking about the changes,” said Michele Hillery, Global Manager of Equity Clearing and DTC Settlement Service at DTCC.   For instance, the ValueExchange — Operationalizing T+1 survey found that 41% of the market still has not yet started planning for T+1. The survey further highlighted that institutional investors appear to be more advanced in their T+1 preparations compared to brokers and custodians3.       An institution’s size is also a decisive factor determining their levels of T+1 planning. “A large broker dealer for instance, is more likely to be compliant with the rules, having already embarked on the T+1 change journey. In contrast, a small broker dealer — which is still reliant on conducting their operations through fax — will probably have a bit more work to do. Budgetary constraints at smaller financial institutions may also be hampering their T+1 efforts,” explained Michele Pitts, Head of NAM Custody Product Management Strategic Initiatives at Citi.   Lou Rosato, Director of Global Investment Operations at BlackRock, shared that the $10 trillion asset manager is currently in the later stages of its T+1 planning. “We have a deep understanding and alignment on the changes that need to happen and have identified key focus areas for a firmwide and unified project with our custodians and brokers.",497
591,"Our formal engagement and planning began in 2022 and it is now ramping up this year,” noted Rosato.   Although major institutions with substantial operations in the US understand the full implications of the T+1 move, many outside of North America are still digesting the potential changes. For instance, the ValueExchange study found that not a single Asia-Pacific based financial institution was executing their T+1 plans, nor had anyone in the region even developed a concrete T+1 project funding request4. The study also revealed that 43% of Asia-Pacific based financial institutions were still in the research and information gathering stages of their T+1 planning efforts, versus 27% of those in Europe and 17% in the US5.   “The most significant impact is likely to be felt at buy and sell-side firms in Asia and Europe. They will need to make substantial changes to their operating, treasury and client service models to support their client trading in a compressed settlement environment. They will experience the most significant impact, but in many respects are the least prepared and have the most work still to do,” said Bryan Murphy, Global Head of Banks Sales, Securities Services, Citi.         By shortening the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1, market participants trading US equities will have much less time between trading and the start of the settlement cycle to perform post-trade processing6. As things currently stand under the T+2 model in the US, the trade allocation and affirmation process takes place at 1130AM Eastern Time (ET) on T+1. Following the introduction of T+1, trade allocations will be brought forward to 0700PM ET on trade date, with a 0900PM ET on trade date cut-off for affirmations.         The diagram also highlights the timing challenges facing financial institutions operating in Europe and Asia-Pacific as it relates to allocations, affirmations and securities lending transactions. As the diagram shows, implementation of T+1 will mean financial institutions will have 16.5 hours less time to process allocations; 14.5 hours less time to process affirmations; and 18 hours less time to process securities lending transactions.",447
592,"global insights securities services t 1 the countdown. T+1: The CountdownOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle07 Jun 2023T+1: The CountdownSecurities ServicesShareOn 28 May, 2024, the US will be transitioning its T+2 equity settlement cycle to T+1, a milestone which will have a significant impact on the operating models of financial institutions all over the world. With T+1 now just 12 months away, what should the industry be doing to prepare for its implementation?Mapping the impact of T+1 T+1 is expected to significantly reduce the amount of time organisations have to complete their post-trade processing. A recent Citi article — “T+1: A Race against Time” — highlighted that firms operating in different time-zones to the US may need to start pre-funding their FX transactions when T+1 makes its debut. The requirement to pre-fund certain trades could be an issue for financial institutions in Asia, whose markets are anywhere between eight hours and 16 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time (EST). Other activities that might face disruption when T+1 takes effect, include securities lending, corporate actions and the cross-border settlement of exchange traded funds, American Depository Receipts and dual listed securities. Furthermore, firms with operations in both the US and Canada should be especially vigilant in the early stages, as Canada is adopting T+1 a day ahead of the US. T+1 could also result in an increase in the number of trade fails leading to firms facing more frequent cash penalties or even higher Basel III risk weighted capital requirements. Although there are no clear-cut rules for penalties for trade fails in the US like there are in the EU, financial institutions may be hesitant about dealing with counterparties suffering from high fail rates. To date, however, industry preparations for T+1 can best be described as mixed. “The tier one firms — especially in the US — appear to be well prepared to begin industry testing in Q3 2023. As we consider tier two and tier three firms, we are hearing that firms are less advanced in their preparedness. Not surprisingly, the levels of awareness and readiness in the US seem to be ahead of what we currently see in Europe and Asia,” shared Michele Hillery, General Manager of Equity Clearing and DTC Settlement Service, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).",493
593,"This is echoed in a recent survey conducted by The ValueExchange, which found 41% of global financial institutions had yet to begin their T+1 preparations, while just 46% said they expected to be ready for the changes. The ValueExchange study revealed that 61% of the buy-side are unprepared for T+1, a problem which appears to be especially acute among mid-tier and boutique firms. “I think there are a lot of misconceptions circulating amongst our clients about whether they are impacted by T+1. Some non-US firms believe they are not affected because the T+1 transition is a SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] rule, and as such they assume it does not apply to them. Others simply think their custodians will handle everything for them, but providers can only do so much,” said Michele Pitts, Custody Product Head for NAM Strategic Initiatives, Securities Services, Citi.   12 months and counting With less than 12 months until T+1 goes live, financial institutions have been urged to start preparing for the switchover. So what has to happen? Firstly, firms should conduct gap analysis to ascertain what they need to do ahead of the implementation date. “From a project management office [PMO] perspective, there are several workstreams firms need to be focusing on, covering technology, regulation and communications,” shared John Ferrara, Vice-President, Risk and Compliance at Fidelity Investments. “Firms should be going through their documentation and making the appropriate language changes to reflect the T+1 move. At Fidelity, we have different business lines, focusing on institutional and retail clients, and how we communicate these changes will differ across our client segments.” The T+1 move may require firms to make substantially more investment into technology and automation than they did during the adoption of T+2 in 2017. “There are some technology changes which were not necessary back in 2017 but would be necessary now. For example, stock plan services were not impacted when the US shifted from T+3 to T+2, as TAs [transfer agents] were sending the shares in a timely manner. Now we are shifting to T+1, the TAs will need to make technology enhancements,” said Ferrara. While some financial institutions are improving their in-house technology systems, others are leveraging existing industry solutions to assist with trade matching, affirmation, delivery and performance benchmarking ahead of T+1.",500
594,"Operational changes may need to be implemented to facilitate T+1 compliance as well. Some of the largest financial institutions currently adopt a so-called “follow the sun” model whereby their operations teams are located across multiple time-zones, enabling them to provide international clients with rolling 24 hour support for T+1. “Some of our global clients are starting to open up East Coast offices to ease the T+1 operational burden,” shared Pitts. These options may not however, be available to smaller or mid-sized firms. If financial institutions cannot reallocate resources to different time-zones, then they may have to adopt shift working patterns to meet their T+1 requirements. Nonetheless, there is growing concern among custodians and brokers about whether to provide out of hours support for those US clients, who will not be ready for T+1 next May. In particular, some providers are looking to put an end to the one-off accommodations they make for certain clients, especially if it forces their operations teams to perform workarounds. End to end testing ahead of T+1 will be critical too. “DTCC will have its test environment ready for industry participants from the middle of August. While we do not anticipate that all market participants will begin testing in August, we expect a large number of firms to begin testing in Q3. A lot of firms are dependent on their service providers, so these institutions will likely be amongst the early wave of testers,” said Hillery. Each of DTCC’s tests will run over a two-week cycle, before being reset, enabling firms to conduct multiple dress rehearsals ahead of the T+1 deadline, including on public holidays. “We do not expect firms to get everything right the first time. Therefore testing often, early and using different scenarios is very important,” continued Hillery. Thorough testing will be critical if financial institutions are to have a smooth T+1 transition. By carefully documenting the testing process, firms will have useful reference points across multiple scenarios when the implementation date finally does arrive. While DTCC’s testing environment is robust, it is limited to the functions offered by DTCC. “DTCC handles an estimated 50% of the testing requirements related to the move to T+1. However, there is a lot that happens outside of DTCC’s four walls that will also require comprehensive testing, including FX for firms with a global footprint, testing with service bureaus and vendors, and any internal operational workflows,” said Hillery.",500
595,"Firms also should assess the resilience of their systems in all areas and perform adequate resiliency testing.   Turning a corner Although firms will have to recalibrate their operations and technology in advance of T+1, some of the biggest changes will be behavioural. “We are looking at our operational processes and how they function in T+2, and assessing what activities need to be moved back to either earlier in the day, or T+1 or even trade date. We are then evaluating what behavioural changes — be it on the client or the vendor side — will need to be made. For instance, if a firm is not affirming transactions, then they need to do it now. The same applies if they are not sending trade files before 4pm. The good news is that behavioural changes can be made well ahead of T+1,” said Ferrara. Along with behavioural changes, financial institutions will have to make substantive adjustments to their operations and technology practices if the switch to T+1 is to be frictionless. Moreover, regular testing will be essential if firms are to iron out errors in good time, and reduce the risks involved in the transition. Firms should take full advantage of DTCC’s testing facilities when they open in the summer. With more markets — including a handful of LATAM countries, the UK and potentially the EU — contemplating shortening their settlement cycles over the next few years, there may still be a long road ahead on this T+1 journey.  UP NEXTArticleT+1 — A race against timeSecurities ServicesArticleSecurities Services Evolution 2022Securities ServicesArticleNavigating The March Towards T+1Securities ServicesLearn more about Securities Services at Citi or contact us* First name* Last name* Company name* Email addressTitleCountry* CommentsPlease do not share personal or account information in your comments submission.I'd like Citi's insights delivered directly to my inbox.You can unsubscribe at any time.Choose area(s) of interestSelectRead Citigroup Privacy NoticesSubmitCancelSubscribeSign up to receive our newsletter providing a roundup of recent content and updates on new reports.EmailNextSign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",470
596,"global insights securities services the future of latam s securities settlement. The Future of LATAM's Securities SettlementOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountArticle15 Jun 2022The Future of LATAM's Securities SettlementSecurities ServicesShareDownloadEfforts to further accelerate the flow of foreign investor capital into LATAM markets are underway, and it is being enabled through a number of initiatives — including stock exchange consolidation and post-trade reforms.Roberto Paolino, Head of Securities Services for Brazil at Citi, sat down with senior executives from the Stock Exchanges of Brazil, Chile and Mexico to discuss how the LATAM region is attempting to deepen its capital markets.   Exchange consolidation takes shape Just as the EU expedited cross-border investment and listing activities through harmonisation of its capital markets, LATAM is looking to follow suit. However, past attempts to facilitate standardisation and connectivity in LATAM’s securities markets did not yield much success. Announced in 2011, the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA) was a well-meaning programme designed to homogenise the equity markets of Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru.   Although the plan was supported by all of the participatory countries’ domestic Stock Exchanges and Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), arbitraging regulations and tax requirements — along with the absence of a shared currency — across the four markets meant trading volumes on MILA were limited.   Despite MILA’s chequered track record, Andres Araya Falcone, Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer at the Santiago Stock Exchange, says this has not deterred regional infrastructures from pursuing other ambitious integration programmes — as they look to stimulate liquidity in LATAM. “We all know that MILA did not have the success many expected, and it was tough and difficult to implement some of the back office processes. However, we have learned a lot from MILA,” says Araya.   In 2020, the Stock Exchanges of Colombia, Chile and Peru confirmed they were in discussions about merging their respective businesses into a single holding company, in what would create the second largest bourse in LATAM. Under the scheme, Colombia Stock Exchange and Santiago Stock Exchange will each control 40% of the holding company, with Lima Stock Exchange owning the remaining 20%.   Admittedly, the consolidation plans were frustrated by COVID-19, but Araya stresses that progress is now being made.",495
597,"“We are ready to start with the integration and are in the process of selecting an international consultancy to work with us. In the next six months, we intend to create a holding company and will define how it will operate. This is a big challenge as we have to harmonise the regulatory rules across all three markets,” adds Araya.   On timing, Araya shares that the holding company’s electronic trading platform is poised to be developed in 2023 followed by the rollout of a clearing and settlement platform in Q3 of 2024 — coinciding with the US’ introduction of T+1. If successful, this combined entity could help unlock liquidity in LATAM by attracting international investment; increasing the number of debt issuers; strengthening trading in derivatives and incentivising regional institutions, such as pension funds, to participate in the local market.1   “The merged entity will be a win-win scenario for shareholders, investors, issuers and intermediaries as consolidation will enable operational synergies to be realised, and this will be reflected in client fees,” says Araya.   T+1 under discussion in LATAM With the US (and Canada) expected to transition from a T+2 settlement cycle to T+1 in 2024, LATAM markets are keen to follow their lead. “When we moved from T+3 to T+2 several years ago, we also talked internally about the possibility of migrating to T+1,”comments Claudio Jacob, Managing Director, International Business Development, Client Relations at B3 in Brazil.   This is echoed by Roberto Gonzalez Barrera, Chief Executive Officer, Post Trade Division at Grupo Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, who notes the Exchange is having high level internal conversations about adopting T+1. “Mexico moved to T+2 at the same time as the US. This is because there is a strong correlation between our two markets. We have started engaging with the brokers’ association and our board to move to T+1 at the same time as the US,” says Gonzalez Barrera.   Araya also indicates that the Santiago Stock Exchange is looking to adopt T+1 as well. “There are a lot of arbitrages between Chile and international markets. Similar to Mexico, when the US market is closed, our trading volumes are reduced,” says Araya.   There are a number of benefits to removing an entire day from the trading settlement cycle.",485
598,"The introduction of T+1 could unlock many risk benefits for market participants, which in turn will expedite operational and cost synergies. As highlighted in “Accelerating the US Securities Settlement Cycle to T+1” — a shorter rolling settlement cycle will mean firms incur reduced systemic, operational and counterparty risk during the trade settlement process, something which could prove vitally important during bouts of volatility. These scaled back risk exposures will mean trading counterparties are subject to lower margin requirements, facilitating cash optimisation.2   “A shift to T+1 could bring about risk reduction benefits for investors, market participants and B3 itself as it would cut the settlement risk by half. Furthermore, T+1 would help Brazil synchronise with global markets, thereby reducing the cost of arbitrage. We also have a number of Brazilian Depository Receipts (BDRs) linked to Europe and North America, while a number of Brazilian companies are also dual listed in the US. Synchronising the time-frame for settlement would help eliminate unnecessary frictions,” says Jacob.   T+1 adoption will also force intermediaries (i.e. custodians) to modernise any antiquated technology infrastructure and legacy systems, in what could potentially negate many of the pain-points synonymous with today’s settlement activities — further crystallising some of the efficiency gains made already. “Compressing T+1 will require significant technology investment to be made by market participants,” says Paolino.   Overall however, financial institutions believe settlement compression will yield major benefits. For example, 44% of market participants surveyed in Citi’s Securities Services Evolution whitepaper said settlement compression would result in greater efficiencies in the investment and trading process.   Despite this, there are some significant barriers potentially impeding T+1’s introduction in LATAM. “There are challenges to adopting T+1 in Brazil. The country has restrictions on pre-matching while STP [straight-through-processing] for allocations takes place on T+0,” says Jacob. Additionally, there are concerns around FX management, as it could force investors in different time-zones to book FX transactions on either T or T+1 — something which might require them to pre-fund their trades.   “One of the major challenges for us is that between 50% to 60% of what is traded in Mexico are foreign securities.",475
599,"Our dual listing of securities program or “Global Market” has grown substantially, and we now have more than 3,000 foreign securities listed. T+1 could pose two issues: for local securities, where US participants are dominant, a trade instruction comes from a US fund to a US broker then to a local broker and after execution, the confirmation and settlement instructions must reach the local custodian same day in order to enable the delivery of the securities the next day (T+1). The other issue is what will happen for Mexican institutions buying, selling or arbitraging foreign securities? We have a lot to do in terms of speeding up the current trade confirmation and post-trade processes,” says Gonzalez Barrera.   In addition, Gonzalez Barrera notes that Mexico’s settlement fail rate under T+2 is currently less than 1%, but this could see a substantial spike if and when T+1 is adopted if they don’t prepare properly for this change.   Is T+0 really on the cards?   With a number of markets actively talking about transitioning to T+1, some believe the introduction of T+0 is an inevitable next step, highlighting it will lead to further improvements in capital optimisation and risk management. Just as the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) — through Project Ion — is trialling distributed ledger technology (DLT) to support T+1 and T+0 settlement — in parallel to its migration to T+1, Paolino questioned whether such a scheme would be feasible in LATAM.   “There are a number of benefits to T+2 and T+1. T+0 does happen in some markets but these are overwhelmingly OTC [over-the-counter] markets where there is no clearing or netting. There is nothing to prevent the establishment of a parallel T+0 market alongside T+2 or T+1, but those trading on T+0 would not get the benefits of T+2 or T+1,” says Jacob.   Again, introducing T+0 is easier said than done. For example, the ISC report argues T+0’s introduction would require a complete restructuring of the clearance and settlement model; revisions to regulatory frameworks and the implementation of real-time currency movements.",455
600,"The report continues that the costs of adopting new technologies would be disproportionately shouldered by smaller or medium sized firms who are reliant on legacy systems.3   “T+0 sounds great on the academic side, but if you look at the materials which the DTCC has published, then you realise it is a big challenge. A lot would need to change if T+0 was to be implemented, including maybe even getting rid of the CCPs [Central Counterparty Clearing Houses] that provide huge benefits such as assuming counterparty risk, netting, anonymous trading, among others. It is a much more ambitious project,” says Gonzalez Barrera.   LATAM continues on its reform journey   As one of the regions hardest hit by COVID-19, LATAM is making huge strides to attract foreign investor capital. In addition to exchange consolidation, the region is open to the idea of settlement compression, replicating what the US is currently doing in terms of adopting T+1. Despite this, there are obstacles to be overcome.   “Past regional integration projects have struggled to gain momentum, while the introduction of T+1 is likely to throw up logistical problems. Nonetheless, LATAM markets are continuing to move forwards and the adoption of a shorter settlement cycle is likely to help drive international inflows into the region’s burgeoning and attractive economies,” concludes Paolino.       1 Reuters — November 30, 2021 — Colombia, Chile and Peru stock exchanges approve merger. 2 SIFMA, ICI, DTCC, Deloitte — December 1, 2021 — Accelerating the US Securities Settlement Cycle to T+1. 3 SIFMA, ICI, DTCC, Deloitte — December 1, 2021 — Accelerating the US Securities Settlement Cycle to T+1.",368

Since then, I have benefited from the career opportunities that come with being at a global bank and have worked across the world. In 2018, I took on the role of leading Citi’s franchise in Ukraine and have had the pleasure of making my home with my family in the beautiful city of Kyiv. At Citi, we like to think of ourselves as a “human bank,” and nowhere has that been more apparent than in Ukraine. When Russia invaded our country last year, the entire firm moved swiftly to support our colleagues and clients. Thanks to the courage and dedication of our Citi Ukraine team, our business here has operated continuously throughout the war. That’s allowed us to support clients on the ground who are overseeing essential services and the non-governmental organizations that are delivering aid. On the cover of this report, you will find some images illustrating these heroic efforts. I am also incredibly grateful to my Citi colleagues in Poland, Romania, Hungary and other neighboring countries who have received displaced Ukrainians and mobilized volunteer efforts. On top of that, so many members of the firm from around the world have found other ways to support us in Ukraine. Simply put, I could not be prouder to work at Citi.

610,"global investors annual reports and proxy statements 2023 annual report letter to shareholders. Global Investment Bank and Financial Services | CitiOKAbout UsBusinessesOur ImpactNewsInvestorsCareersMy AccountHome/Investors/Annual Reports and Proxy Statements/2022 Annual Report/Letter to ShareholdersLetter to Shareholders Dear shareholders, Looking back at 2022, I don’t think any of us could have predicted the twists and turns the year would take. Lingering disruptions to supply chains, historic inflationary pressures, persistent lockdowns in China and the largest war on European soil since World War II combined to create a tumultuous environment for businesses and financial markets. As a leading global bank with a more-than-210-year history, these dynamics are not unfamiliar to us. And as we showed throughout the pandemic, Citi is an important source of strength and stability during times of immense change and challenge. This is an opportunity and a responsibility we take very seriously. So, for me, 2022 will be remembered most for two things:  The first is how we continued to support our clients. We helped them navigate macro and geopolitical dynamics. We advised them in their digital transformations and supported the shifts in their business models. We guided them in their transitions toward a clean-energy economy. When war broke out in Ukraine, we sprang to the aid of our employees and clients on the ground, and helped our multinational clients unwind their operations in Russia in response to Western sanctions aimed at the country.  The second is the important strides we are making to position Citi to win in the decade ahead. In March 2022, at our first Investor Day in several years, we set a vision and refreshed our strategy to change our business mix and simplify our operating model. We have absolute clarity on our future, and we are focused on accelerating growth, gaining share and increasing returns for shareholders over time.  By most measures, we ended the year in a stronger position than we started.   A foundation for the future Our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent banking partner for institutions with cross-border needs, a global leader in wealth management and a valued personal bank in our home market.  To that end, we have laid the foundation by focusing on five core interconnected businesses: Services, Markets, Banking, Global Wealth Management and U.S. Personal Banking. We intentionally designed our business mix to withstand different macroeconomic conditions, and we have seen that borne out over the past year.",501
611,"So whilst the environment has changed, our strategy has not, and we remain steadfast in executing and delivering for our shareholders. For the year, we delivered $14.8 billion in net income on revenues of $75.3 billion. Our Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE1) was 8.9%, and we remain on track to achieve an RoTCE of 11–12% in the medium term.  We increased our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio by nearly 80 basis points to 13%, which includes a buffer of 100 basis points above the regulatory requirement to help absorb the impact of various macro and other factors. Finally, our tangible book value per share1 increased to $81.65, and we returned more than $7 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases.  We have absolute clarity on our future, and we are focused on accelerating growth, gaining share and increasing returns for shareholders over time. How our core businesses fared Our Services business had an exceptional year with revenues up 27% versus 2021. Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), the crown jewel of our global network, experienced a 32% increase in revenues as we continued to grow our wallet share with existing clients whilst also adding new client relationships. With the introduction of a seven-day sweeps service, the industry’s first 24/7 USD clearing capabilities and instant payments in 33 markets, we’re moving closer to an always-on, near real-time cash management solution for corporate clients. In Securities Services, we grew yearly revenues by 15% and onboarded $1.2 trillion in assets under custody and administration.  Our Markets business closed 2022 with revenues up 7% from 2021, ending the year with one of the best fourth quarters in recent memory. Our traders navigated the volatility quite well, with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and rates. And together with our Corporate Bank, our Markets team continued to optimize its balance sheet.  Revenues in Banking fell 35% as we contended with a materially slower deal environment. But Banking remains a key part of our strategy, and we continued to play a leading role in the year’s notable transactions.",455
612,"This included acting as one of the lead advisors on Volkswagen’s €9.4 billion IPO of Porsche, the largest public listing of the year, and serving as financial advisor to Amgen on its proposed $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. We hired exceptional bankers in healthcare, clean energy and technology — all sectors critical to our growth — and welcomed new talent into our Commercial Bank as it has expanded into Canada, Germany and Switzerland. In U.S. Personal Banking, revenues for the year rose 7% as we bolstered our leadership in payments and lending. Branded Cards grew revenues by 9%, whilst Retail Services revenues were up 7%. We launched new credit cards with ExxonMobil and AT&T and celebrated 35 years of our co-branded credit card partnership with American Airlines. Revenues in Retail Banking were roughly flat for the full year, but we continued to enhance our digital capabilities, growing digital users by 6% for the year. And as part of our efforts to break down barriers to banking, last year we became the first of the largest U.S. banks to completely eliminate overdraft fees and returned item fees for our customers. We also made progress building out our Global Wealth Management business despite the economic headwinds that slowed activity amongst our Asia-based clients in particular and reduced overall revenues by 2%. Having unified our Wealth businesses under a single platform, we’ve been acquiring new clients and investing in hiring advisors to make sure we’re well-positioned for success as the markets recover. In addition, we forged ahead with our global expansion, opening Private Bank offices in Paris and Frankfurt, a new Wealth center in Hong Kong and a Citi Global Wealth at Work presence in Luxembourg.   Greater connectivity and focus A centerpiece of our go-forward plan is increasing the linkages between our businesses so we can more easily engage clients in one part of our firm with products and services from another. By delivering the full power of Citi to clients, we can deepen existing relationships and win new mandates.  Our Markets and Banking businesses are now aligned more closely than ever, and, as a result, we are supporting our clients in a more integrated way. Our Wealth business is also benefiting from closer connections and received more than 60,000 referrals from the Retail Bank last year.",463
613,"In addition, we have established a new partnership agreement between Wealth and our Commercial Bank, where 90% of our clients are privately owned companies.  At the same time, we are making progress in simplifying our firm, making us easier to manage and allowing us to focus on the parts of our business where we know we can grow and improve our competitiveness.  We announced our intention to exit 14 consumer businesses in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Mexico — businesses that do not have clear synergies with our global network. As a result of swift but disciplined execution, in 2022 we successfully closed the sale of our consumer businesses in Australia, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. In March 2023, we closed the sale of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and are on track to close two additional markets by the end of the year. We also are progressing with the wind-down of our consumer business in Korea. In addition to exiting our consumer and local commercial banking businesses in Russia, we are actively ending nearly all institutional banking services in the country, and by the second quarter of 2023, our only operations will be those necessary to fulfill any legal and regulatory obligations. Apart from Russia, Citi will continue to serve our clients and invest in these markets through our institutional franchise and our Wealth business.   Citi’s Transformation For our strategy to unlock the greatest possible value, we know we need to modernize our infrastructure so that we are scaled and agile and able to continue to deliver for our clients. The consent orders issued in 2020 by the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency underscored how we had underinvested not only in parts of our infrastructure but also in our risk and controls environment and our data governance. Last year, we made progress in accelerating our work to address these gaps and simplify and modernize our operating model for the digital age. This work is so consequential in nature that we call it our “Transformation.” It remains my number one priority. Whilst this is a multi-year journey, we are already seeing the fruits of our labors. We have dramatically streamlined our approval process for new products. And new stress testing capabilities enable us to make faster, better-informed risk decisions.",457
614,"This made a huge difference in how we have been able to minimize the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on all parts of our business.   Investments in our people and communities Ensuring we have a culture characterized by excellence and accountability underpins the success of our Transformation and broader vision for the firm. Last year, we launched a program, Citi’s New Way, to help our colleagues adopt the everyday habits we need in order to operate with excellence. We have also hardwired accountability into our firm by strengthening our performance management process and implementing a greater emphasis on financial returns rather than on revenues.  The diversity of the nearly 240,000 people who work at Citi is a distinguishing aspect of our firm, as is the diversity of our Board, which is majority female. We remain committed to a workplace that mirrors the communities we serve. In 2022, we set new goals to increase the number of women and other underrepresented groups working at Citi. These new goals follow our success in exceeding the three-year goals we set in 2018 to increase the percentage of women in the firm globally and of Black talent in the U.S.  In another sign of our progress, last year we celebrated the promotion of one of the largest and most diverse Managing Director classes in recent years. Maintaining a workplace that is diverse, equitable and inclusive is not only true to our values but key to our competitiveness. Our commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion goes well beyond Citi’s walls as we continue to use our resources as a global bank to take on some of society’s toughest challenges. We expanded the Citi Impact Fund to $500 million in support of diverse founders who are driving both financial and social returns. And we delivered on our commitment to transparency and accountability by announcing the findings from an external review and audit of our $1 billion Action for Racial Equity initiative to help close the racial wealth gap. We have also been a leader in reimagining the future of work. Drawing on lessons learned during the pandemic, we have institutionalized a hybrid work model for much of our firm. This approach provides the flexibility that our people want whilst also ensuring we benefit from the in-person collaboration, real-time coaching and apprenticeship that occurs only when we are physically together.  Everywhere you look around the firm, there is an undeniable sense of momentum.",475

Since then, Citibank has distinguished itself in the credit card securitization market by its innovativeness. Citibank was the first bank credit card ABS issuer to apply many now-familiar and standard structural features: bullet principal repayment, credit enhancement via Class B subordinated securities, single-seller commercial paper (CP) program, non-USD denominated securities issuance, and de-linked subordinated securities.   Citibank has consistently applied securitization to fund a portion of its credit card portfolio. The securitization market has been reliable across market cycles, and has provided liquidity out to 30 years. Currently, securitization funds approximately 10% of Citibank's U.S. credit card business. The proportion of funding raised through securitization may vary due to changes in business strategy.  Sign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S. Personal BankingOur ImpactSustainabilityStrengthening CommunityDiversity, Equity and InclusionInvestorsQuarterly EarningsEvents and PresentationsAnnual Reports and Proxy StatementsSEC FilingsOther Regulatory FilingsFixed Income Investor RelationsStockholder ServicesCorporate GovernanceESG for InvestorsInvestor ContactsNewsPress ReleasesPerspectivesInsightsMedia ResourcesCareersAlumniContact UsRegulatory DisclosuresCareersAlumniContact UsRegulatory DisclosuresTermsPrivacyNotice at CollectionCA Privacy HubAccessibilitySuppliersEthics HotlineContact Us",433

The yearly issuance plan is built around a target level of funding for the entire credit card business to be furnished through securitization. This target level can vary from year to year, but has remained within a range of 5%-20% over the last ten years. Currently, securitization funds approximately 5% of Citibank's U.S. credit card business. The volume of securitization in a calendar year derives from maturing securitizations and portfolio growth and acquisition. Each year, a target average maturity of borrowings is determined. The goal is to limit the amount of securities to re-finance at any time, by applying upper limits on the amount of securities maturing in any month, quarter, and year. The entire curve is used, from commercial paper out to 30 years. Fixed- and floating-rate securities can be issued, according to investor demand; interest rate exposure decisions are made independently of issuance decisions. Non-USD securities can be issued, but these are swapped back to USD, as the Trust cannot have currency exposure. Subordinated securities are offered independently of senior securities (i.e., they are ""de-linked""), but senior securities cannot be issued if there are insufficient amounts of available subordinated securities outstanding. CCCIT, which was introduced in 2000, is the current issuance vehicle out of the Citibank Credit Card Master Trust. CCCIT had outstanding securities totaling $6.1 billion as of November 30, 2023.Sign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",470

In September 2000, Citibank Credit Card Issuance Trust (CCCIT) became the primary issuance vehicle of notes supported by the credit card receivables owned by CCCMTI. CCCMTI owns the receivables supporting all issuance of notes by these vehicles.CCCMTI's securitizations are backed by credit card receivables originated and serviced by Citibank, N.A. (rated Moody's A2/ S&P A/ Fitch A). Citibank became seller of receivables to, and servicer of, the Master Trust as a result of its merger with Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. on July 1, 2011. The eligibility criteria for the receivables that can be sold to the Master Trust include the following: the receivables must be from accounts owned by Citibank or an affiliate; the cardholders must not have been in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding; the receivables must be denominated in U.S. dollars. CCCIT securities are issued in the form of notes, governed by New York law. CCCIT issues three classes of securities: Class A (rated Aaa/AAA/AAA), Class B (rated A2/AA/A), and Class C (rated Baa2/A/BBB). Classes B and C are subordinated to Class A and are part of the credit enhancement structure. The issuance of CCCIT Class B and C securities is independent of the issuance of Class A securities, however, Class A and Class B securities cannot be issued if the required enhancement for that Class (Classes B and C for A; Class C for B) is insufficient. CCCIT StructureFollowing are the salient features of CCCIT securities.",499
625,"Please see the applicable Prospectus for a full description of the securities' mechanics. Classes issued by CCCIT are grouped together for the allocation of finance charge receivable cash flows. Thus, there is a single set of monthly cash flows that generates excess spread for all the notes, rather than for individual securities. This is commonly referred to as a ""socialized"" trust structure. Please refer to the applicable Prospectus for the allocation order of finance charge receivables. On an ongoing (monthly) basis, the Master Trust purchases credit card receivables to ensure that the face amount of securities remains outstanding until maturity, even though cardholders may pay any amount from the minimum up to the full amount owed. Principal cash flows are shared across all Classes of notes. If any one Class is set to repay principal but its pro-rata share of principal cash flows (from the underlying credit card receivables) is insufficient, that Class can utilize principal from all other Classes that are not likewise needed to repay principal. Credit enhancement, along with excess spread and an early amortization feature, support the ratings of each Class of security. For example, credit enhancement levels for CCCIT Class A term notes consist of 5.98291% of Class B notes and 7.97721% of Class C notes (expressed as a percentage of Class A notes). In addition, all CCCIT notes have the benefit of the Series 2009 Credit Card Participation Certificate, issued by CCMTI on May 1, 2009. The principal amount of the Series 2009 Certificate will generally be equal to 3.84764% of all outstanding CCCIT notes. The total credit enhancement levels for each class of notes are established by Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch, and are shown in the structure slide at the top of this page. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is the trustee for CCCMTI and is the indenture trustee for CCCIT. Its principal corporate trust office is located at 60 Wall Street, Attention: Global Securities Services - Structured Finance Services, New York, New York 10005.Sign up to receive the latest news from Citi.Email Address**Required FieldSelect PreferencesSendAbout UsStrategyGlobal PresenceLeadershipHeritageBusinessesServicesMarketsBanking and InternationalWealthU.S.",469

This compares to net income of $3.5 billion, or $1.63 per diluted share, on revenues of $18.5 billion for the third quarter 2022.     Revenues increased 9% from the prior-year period, largely driven by strength across Services and Markets in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and US Personal Banking within Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM), as well as growth in Banking in ICG. This increase was partially offset by a revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs within Legacy Franchises.  Third quarter results included divestiture-related impacts of $299 million5 in earnings before taxes ($214 million after-tax), primarily driven by a gain on the sale of the Taiwan consumer business, recorded in Legacy Franchises. Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, earnings per share was $1.525. This compares to divestiture-related impacts in the third quarter 2022 of $519 million5 in earnings before taxes ($256 million after-tax), also recorded in Legacy Franchises, and earnings per share of $1.50, excluding divestiture-related impacts5. Net income of $3.5 billion increased 2% from the prior-year period.",497
646,"Excluding divestiture-related impacts5, net income increased 3%. The increase in net income was primarily driven by the higher revenue, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Citi CEO Jane Fraser said, “Despite the headwinds, our five core, interconnected businesses each posted revenue growth resulting in overall growth of 9%. Services, our fastest growing business, grew by 13% with Treasury and Trade Solutions having its best quarter in a decade. Markets was up 10% driven by strength in Fixed Income. Banking activity played to our mix and grew 17%, bolstered by a rebound in debt issuance and some signs of life in the equity capital markets. U.S. Personal Banking also had double-digit revenue growth while a continued deceleration in spending indicates an increasingly cautious consumer. And Wealth revenues grew as the business continues to win new mandates and acquire new clients. “Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% which is $14 billion above our current regulatory minimum after returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. Our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base. Taken with our high-quality asset portfolio, strong reserve levels, ample liquidity and diversified earnings base, we are proving to our clients that we truly are a bank for all seasons. “Last month we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank. When completed, we will have a simpler firm that can operate faster, better serve our clients and unlock value for our shareholders,” Ms. Fraser concluded. Percentage comparisons throughout this press release are calculated for the third quarter 2023 versus the third quarter 2022, unless otherwise specified. Third Quarter Financial Results Citigroup Citigroup revenues of $20.1 billion in the third quarter 2023 increased 9%. The higher revenues reflected strength across Services, US Personal Banking and Markets, as well as growth in Banking, which was offset by the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Citigroup operating expenses of $13.5 billion in the third quarter 2023 increased 6%, largely driven by investments in risk and controls, severance and the impact of inflation.",454
647,"The expense increase was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the closed exits and wind-downs. Citigroup cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion in the third quarter 2023, compared to $1.4 billion in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the continued normalization in net credit losses and volume growth in cards in PBWM. A net build in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans and unfunded commitments of $125 million was primarily driven by Branded Cards and Retail Services, largely related to growth in card balances.  Citigroup net income of $3.5 billion in the third quarter 2023 increased 2% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by the higher revenues, partially offset by the higher expenses and the higher cost of credit. Citigroup’s effective tax rate increased to approximately 25% in the current quarter versus 20% in the third quarter 2022, primarily driven by a different geographic mix of pre-tax earnings in the current quarter.  Citigroup’s total allowance for credit losses on loans was approximately $17.6 billion at quarter end, compared to $16.3 billion at the end of the prior-year period, with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of 2.68%, compared to 2.54% at the end of the prior-year period. Total non-accrual loans increased 14% from the prior-year period to $3.3 billion. Corporate non-accrual loans increased 33% to $2.0 billion. Consumer non-accrual loans decreased (7)% to $1.3 billion.  Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $666 billion at quarter end, up 3% versus the prior-year period, largely reflecting growth in US Personal Banking.  Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion at quarter end, down (3)% versus the prior-year period. The decline in deposits was largely due to a reduction in Services, reflecting quantitative tightening, a shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments in Global Wealth Management and a reduction of institutional certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other.  Citigroup’s book value per share of $99.28 and tangible book value per share of $86.90 at quarter end increased 7% and 8%, respectively, versus the prior-year period.",482
648,"The increases were largely driven by net income to common, common share repurchases, and beneficial movements in the accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) component of equity, partially offset by payment of common dividends. At quarter end, Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.5% versus 13.4% in the prior quarter, as net income to common, a benefit from the Taiwan consumer exit and a lower deferred tax assets deduction were partially offset by common dividends and share repurchases. Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio for the third quarter 2023 was 6.0%, which was largely unchanged from the prior quarter. During the quarter, Citigroup returned a total of $1.5 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. Institutional Clients Group ICG revenues of $10.6 billion were up 12% (including gain/(loss) on loan hedges6), driven by growth across Services, Markets and Banking, partially offset by an approximately $180 million net impact from a currency devaluation in Argentina on Citi’s net investment in the country. Services revenues of $4.7 billion increased 13%. TTS revenues of $3.6 billion increased 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income, as well as 1% growth in non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and deposit volume growth. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by continued growth in underlying drivers, largely offset by the impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina on our net investment in the country. Securities Services revenues of $1.1 billion increased 16%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. Markets revenues of $4.5 billion increased 10%, driven by Fixed Income. Fixed Income revenues of $3.6 billion increased 14%, largely driven by strength in rates and currencies. Equity revenues of $918 million were down (3)%, driven by a decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in cash and prime.  Banking revenues of $1.4 billion increased 18%, including gain/(loss) on loan hedges in the current quarter and the prior-year period. Excluding gain/(loss) on loan hedges6, Banking revenues of $1.5 billion increased 17%, driven by higher revenues in Investment Banking.",477
649,"Investment Banking revenues of $844 million increased 34%, reflecting increased client activity in debt underwriting and the absence of certain realized and unrealized gain/(losses). Excluding the impact of these marks7, Investment Banking revenues increased 12% versus the prior-year period. Excluding gain/(loss) on loan hedges6, Corporate Lending revenues were up 1% versus the prior-year period. ICG operating expenses of $7.2 billion increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in risk and controls, volume related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. ICG cost of credit of $196 million, compared to $86 million in the prior-year period, included net credit losses of $51 million, an ACL build for loans and unfunded commitments of $61 million and other provisions of $84 million. ICG net income of $2.4 billion increased 12%, driven by the higher revenues, partially offset by the higher expenses and the higher cost of credit.  Personal Banking and Wealth Management PBWM revenues of $6.8 billion increased 10%, driven by growth in net interest income, reflecting strong loan growth in US Personal Banking, as well as higher non-interest revenue, primarily due to lower partner payments in Retail Services and higher investment product revenues in Global Wealth Management. US Personal Banking revenues of $4.9 billion increased 13%. Branded Cards revenues of $2.5 billion increased 12%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, reflecting the strong loan growth. Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion increased 21%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income from loan growth, as well as the lower partner payments. Retail Banking revenues of $624 million decreased (3)%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to Global Wealth Management, partially offset by the strength in deposit spreads. Global Wealth Management revenues of $1.9 billion increased 2%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships from Retail Banking, higher investment fees and higher lending revenue.  PBWM operating expenses of $4.3 billion increased 5%, largely driven by investments in risk and controls and severance, partially offset by productivity savings. PBWM cost of credit was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in the prior-year period.",468
650,"The increase was largely driven by higher net credit losses of $1.4 billion, reflecting continued normalization in Branded Cards and Retail Services.  PBWM net income of $803 million increased 1%, driven by the higher revenue, largely offset by the higher cost of credit and the higher expenses. Legacy Franchises Legacy Franchises revenues of $2.2 billion decreased (13)%, largely driven by the difference in one-time gain on sale impacts in the Asia consumer businesses and reductions from closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico, reflecting Mexico peso appreciation, higher interest rates and volume growth.  Legacy Franchises expenses of $1.8 billion decreased (3)%, primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by separation costs in Mexico and the Mexican peso appreciation. Legacy Franchises cost of credit was $188 million, compared to $167 million in the prior-year period, reflecting net credit losses of $219 million, partially offset by a net ACL release for loans and unfunded commitments.  Legacy Franchises net income was $125 million, compared to $316 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the lower revenues and the higher cost of credit, partially offset by the lower expenses.  Corporate / Other Corporate / Other revenues increased to $500 million from $299 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by the absence of the mark-to-market impacts on certain derivative transactions in the prior-year period. Corporate / Other expenses of $237 million decreased from $286 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower consulting fees. Corporate / Other income from continuing operations was $190 million, compared to $221 million in the prior-year period, reflecting the higher net revenue, lower expenses and the absence of certain income tax benefit items related to non-U.S. operations in the prior-year period.

The new, flatter structure elevates the leaders of Citi’s five businesses and eliminates management layers, which will speed up decision making, drive increased accountability and strengthen the focus on clients.

(NYSE:C) ShareCiti Releases Annual Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report for 2022April 24, 2023NEW YORK – Citi today released its 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report, highlighting progress across Citi and the Citi Foundation toward building more sustainable, diverse and equitable communities around the world. This annual report provides more information on the performance and management of Citi’s commitments to address environmental and social priorities, while building long-term value for Citi stakeholders.  “At Citi, helping our clients navigate the challenges and embrace the opportunities of our rapidly changing world is fundamental to our mission of enabling growth and economic progress,” said Jane Fraser, CEO, Citi. “Importantly, it’s also vital to our own business and central to how we deliver for our clients and help them sustain their businesses for the future.”   Highlights of the report include:  Supporting Citi's Commitment to Sustainable Finance: Through its $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Goal, Citi is facilitating a wide range of activities from renewable energy and clean technology to healthcare and affordable housing. From 2020 through 2022, Citi has financed and facilitated a total of $348.5 billion in sustainable finance activity globally, which puts the company well on track to meet its goal by 2030. Increasing Affordable Housing: In 2022, Citi provided approximately $6 billion in loans for affordable housing projects, making Citi the top affordable housing development lender in the U.S. for the 13th consecutive year.  Supporting Clients in the Energy Transition and Net Zero: As part of its commitment to reaching net zero by 2050, Citi recently announced 2030 emissions reduction targets for four new loan portfolio sectors: Auto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining. Citi has also reorganized its business to meet the opportunities posed by the energy transition. This includes increasing climate-specific training for its banking teams and expanding its Clean Energy Transitions banking team, which provides advisory and capital-raising services for companies involved in the energy transition.",501
659,"Sourcing 100% Renewable Electricity for Citi Operations and Facilities: Citi maintained 100% renewable electricity sourcing for its sites and facilities, as part of its broader net zero goal to reduce the environmental footprint of Citi operations.  Helping to Close the Racial Wealth Gap: Citi made progress on Action for Racial Equity, Citi and the Citi Foundation’s three-year, $1.1 billion effort to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the U.S., and publicly shared the results of their independent third-party racial equity audit. In addition, Citi announced its plan to scale the Citi Impact Fund to $500 million, which will expand the firm’s ability to make direct equity investments in companies led by diverse founders that help solve critical issues for underserved communities.   Advancing Strategic Philanthropy: Through its Pathways to Progress initiative, Community Finance Innovation Fund and more, the Citi Foundation provided $94 million in grants to organizations working across youth economic opportunity, financial inclusion and community solutions.  Continuing Transparency around Pay Equity: Earlier this year, Citi disclosed its annual public update on pay equity, highlighting progress on reducing the pay gap for women globally and U.S. minorities at the firm.

This compares to net income of $3.2 billion, or $1.46 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2021. Fourth quarter results included divestiture-related impacts of approximately $192 million in earnings before taxes (approximately $113 million after-tax), primarily driven by a gain on the sale of the Thailand consumer business. Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, earnings per share was $1.10(5). This compares to divestiture-related impacts in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $1.2 billion in earnings before taxes (approximately $1.1 billion after-tax), primarily driven by costs related to the Korea voluntary early retirement program (VERP)(5). Revenues increased 6% from the prior-year period and 5% excluding the divestiture-related impacts(5), as growth in net interest income was partially offset by lower non-interest revenues.",486
662,"The higher net interest income was driven by the impact of higher interest rates across businesses and strong loan growth in Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM). The lower non-interest revenues reflected declines in Investment Banking in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and lower investment product revenues in Global Wealth Management in PBWM. Net income of $2.5 billion decreased 21% from the prior-year period, and decreased 43% excluding the divestiture-related impacts, primarily driven by higher cost of credit, largely resulting from the loan growth in PBWM and deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions, partially offset by the higher revenues and lower expenses. Earnings per share of $1.16 decreased 21% from the prior-year period, reflecting the lower net income, partially offset by an approximate 2% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year 2022, Citigroup reported net income of $14.8 billion on revenues of $75.3 billion, compared to net income of $22.0 billion on revenues of $71.9 billion for the full year 2021. Citi CEO Jane Fraser said, “One of our major goals in 2022 was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our shareholders and I am pleased with the significant progress we have already made in terms of our Transformation, simplification and strengthening our five interconnected businesses, some of which delivered excellent results this quarter. “With their revenues up 32%, Services delivered another excellent quarter, and we have gained significant share in both Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services. Markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory, driven by a 31% increase in Fixed Income, while Banking and Wealth Management were impacted by the same market conditions they faced throughout the year. Our cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter, and we continue to make progress on our international consumer exits, closing five sales to date. “Over the course of 2022, we returned over $7 billion to our shareholders. We ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of 13% and a tangible book value per share of $81.65. We intentionally designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments, and we are very much on track to reach the medium-term return targets we shared on Investor Day,” Ms. Fraser concluded.",490
663,"Percentage comparisons throughout this press release are calculated for the fourth quarter 2022 versus the fourth quarter 2021, unless otherwise specified. Fourth Quarter Financial Results Citigroup Citigroup revenues of $18.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2022 increased 6%. Excluding the divestiture-related impacts, primarily driven by the gain on the sale of the Thailand consumer business in the current quarter, revenues were up 5%, as the impacts of higher interest rates across businesses and the strong loan growth in US Personal Banking were partially offset by the decline in Investment Banking and the lower investment product revenues in Global Wealth Management as well as impacts from the closed exit markets.   Citigroup operating expenses of $13.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2022 decreased 4%, primarily driven by the absence of divestiture-related costs related to the Korea VERP in the prior-year period. Operating expenses included approximately $58 million of divestiture-related costs in the current quarter, compared to approximately $1.2 billion in the prior-year period. Excluding these costs in both periods, expenses increased 5%, largely driven by transformation investments, business-led investments, and volume-related expenses, partially offset by the benefit of productivity savings and expense reduction of the market exits. Citigroup cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2022, compared to $(0.5) billion in the prior-year period, reflecting a net build in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans and unfunded commitments of $640 million, primarily due to the loan growth in PBWM and the deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions, compared to a net ACL release of $(1.4) billion in the prior-year period. The higher cost of credit also reflected higher net credit losses, primarily driven by ongoing normalization in cards, particularly in Retail Services. Citigroup net income of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2022 decreased 21% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by the higher cost of credit, partially offset by the higher revenues and lower expenses. Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 20.2% in the current quarter versus 19.5% in the fourth quarter 2021.",463
664,"Citigroup’s total allowance for credit losses on loans was approximately $17.0 billion at quarter end, with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of 2.60%, compared to $16.5 billion, or 2.49% of funded loans, at the end of the prior-year period. Total non-accrual loans decreased 28% from the prior-year period to $2.4 billion. Consumer non-accrual loans decreased 28% to $1.3 billion and corporate non-accrual loans decreased 28% to $1.1 billion. Citigroup's end-of-period loans were $657 billion at quarter end, down 2% versus the prior-year period, as the decline in Legacy Franchises more than offset growth in US Personal Banking and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Citigroup's end-of-period deposits were $1.4 trillion at quarter end, an increase of 4% versus the prior-year period, largely driven by deposit growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), partially offset by lower deposits in Legacy Franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Citigroup's book value per share of $94.06 and tangible book value per share of $81.65 at quarter end increased 2% and 3%, respectively, largely driven by the net income and the lower shares outstanding, partially offset by adverse movements in the accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) component of equity and payment of common dividends. At quarter end, Citigroup’s CET1 capital ratio was 13.0% versus 12.3% in the prior quarter, largely reflecting the benefits of net income, closing of exit markets, and the optimization of risk-weighted assets (RWA). Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio for the fourth quarter 2022 was 5.8% versus 5.7% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, Citigroup returned a total of $1 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends.

Strong performance in TTS was driven by business actions, which included managing deposit repricing, deepening of relationships with existing clients, and significant new client wins across all segments, as well as the benefit of higher interest rates. Securities Services revenues of $1.0 billion increased 22%, as net interest income increased significantly, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partially offset by a 9% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of lower market valuations on assets under custody and administration. Markets revenues of $3.9 billion increased 18%, largely driven by growth in Fixed Income Markets. Fixed Income Markets revenues of $3.2 billion increased 31%, driven by strength in rates and currencies. Equity Markets revenues of $789 million were down 14%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in prime services. Banking revenues of $0.9 billion decreased 62%, including gain/losses on loan hedges in the current quarter and the prior-year period. Excluding gain/losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 48%, driven by lower revenues in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking revenues of $645 million decreased 58%, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. Excluding gain/losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues decreased 26% versus the prior-year period, driven by lower volumes, higher credit default swap premiums, and impacts of foreign exchange translation. ICG operating expenses of $6.6 billion increased 6%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments, and volume-related expenses, partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange translation and productivity savings.revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. ICG cost of credit of $56 million, compared to $(281) million in the prior-year period, included a net ACL release for loans and unfunded commitments of $(54) million and net credit losses of $104 million.",501
666,"The ACL release was primarily driven by the reduction of certain direct exposures in Russia, partially offset by an increase related to the deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. ICG net income of $1.9 billion decreased 18%, largely driven by the higher expenses and the higher cost of credit, partially offset by the higher revenues. Personal Banking and Wealth Management PBWM revenues of $6.1 billion increased 5%, as net interest income growth, driven by strong loan growth across US Personal Banking and higher interest rates, was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue, driven by the lower investment product revenues in Global Wealth Management and higher partner payments in Retail Services.   US Personal Banking revenues of $4.4 billion increased 10%. Branded Cards revenues of $2.4 billion increased 15%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income. In Branded Cards, card spend volumes increased 9% and average loans increased 13%. Retail Services revenues of $1.4 billion increased 10%, driven by higher interest-earning balances, partially offset by the higher partner payments. Retail Banking revenues of $608 million decreased 3%, primarily driven by lower mortgage volumes. Global Wealth Management revenues of $1.7 billion decreased 6%, as investment product revenue headwinds, more than offset net interest income growth from the higher interest rates particularly in Asia. Excluding Asia(7), revenues were largely unchanged. PBWM operating expenses of $4.3 billion increased 7%, primarily driven by transformation investments and other risk and control initiatives. PBWM cost of credit was $1.7 billion compared to $(296) million in the prior-year period. The increase was largely driven by a net build in the ACL for loans and unfunded commitments of $752 million in the current quarter, primarily driven by cards volume growth and the deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions, compared to a net ACL release of $869 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses of $908 million increased 60% from near historically low levels, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in Retail Services.

667,"Legacy Franchises Legacy Franchises revenues of $2.1 billion decreased 6%, primarily driven by the reduction in revenues from the closing of five exit markets and the impact of the Korea consumer and Russia consumer wind-downs, partially offset by the Thailand consumer business gain on sale.   Legacy Franchises expenses of $1.8 billion decreased 38%, driven by the absence of the $1.2 billion divestiture-related costs in the prior-year period and the benefits from exit markets. Legacy Franchises cost of credit was $123 million, compared to $112 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a larger net ACL release for loans and unfunded commitments in the prior-year period, partially offset by lower net credit losses in the current quarter. Legacy Franchises net income was $72 million, compared to a net loss of $616 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the lower expenses, partially offset by the lower revenues. Corporate / Other Corporate / Other revenues increased to $699 million from $131 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, primarily due to higher interest rates.   Corporate / Other expenses expenses of $247 million decreased 23%, driven by lower consulting expenses.

Pay equity is key to hiring and retaining top-tier, diverse talent and rewarding performance consistent with our Leadership Standards. We rely on our people to succeed in the digital era. To foster an equitable culture, we continuously evaluate market conditions and rigorously review pay recommendations across the firm as part of our annual compensation process each year. In recent years, we’ve expanded on those efforts to assess pay at Citi when comparing women to men and U.S. minorities to non-minorities. Beginning in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, we conducted an analysis focusing on a number of factors including job function, job level and geography. We found that women are paid on average 99% of what men are paid, and minorities are paid on average 99% of what non-minorities are paid. During compensation cycles, we are making appropriate increases to help close the gaps for both women and U.S. minorities. We will also continue to adjust compensation for other individuals where the analysis determined increases are warranted. We are committed to continuing to review compensation for pay equity and will continue this analysis in all other countries and jurisdictions where our employees work. Pay equity is an imperative. Data consistently points to a pay gap among men and women, and minorities and non-minorities employees, across industries. At Citi, our continuing focus on pay equity brings us closer to being the employer of choice for individuals of diverse backgrounds.How We Work Citi proudly embraces a culture of flexible work.

Suppliers must have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with all of the obligations identified below, including but not limited to appropriate non-discrimination and non-retaliation policies. Suppliers must also make reasonable efforts to monitor and ensure their supply chain is compliant with Citi’s requirements. Citigroup Inc. (Citi) is a federal government contractor. Citi’s policy is to provide equal opportunity to applicants and employees. Citi takes affirmative action with respect to women, minorities, protected veterans and individuals with disabilities.",400
706,"As applicable, Citi requests appropriate action on your part to support these principles.Key Policies and Regulatory Compliance Documents to Review Citi Code of Conduct Citi Requirements for Suppliers Citi Statement of Supplier Principles Citi Supplier Diversity Program Citi Non-Employee & Supplier Online Privacy Notice California Privacy Notice Expectations for SuppliersCiti seeks suppliers who: Understand how their products and services can directly benefit Citi and the financial solutions and services we offer to our customers Share our commitment to performance excellence on the basis of price, quality, availability, terms and service Are financially healthy and who continuously are focused on improving affordability and efficiency Provide shared knowledge on how we can all better manage our businesses Deliver value and solutions that allow Citi, our suppliers, and our customers to win Conduct their operations in a professional and respectful manner Share our commitment to ethical business practices Are committed to increased productivity, process automation and electronic communication Providing Goods and Services to CitiWhen providing products or services to Citi, third parties should consider the following information about our company’s supply chain processes and programs. Citi’s Resource Management Organization operates through an end-to-end supplier lifecycle model. Prior to establishing a relationship, Citi will work with the supplier to address applicable pre-contract due diligence and conduct applicable control assessments, as well as information requirements. To become and remain a Citi supplier, all suppliers must adhere to Citi’s Third Party Management Policy and Standards as referenced in Citi’s Code of Conduct and follow these throughout all phases of the third-party management cycle. Citi selects suppliers based on price, quality, availability, terms and service. An executed contract or an official Citi Purchase Order (PO) is required prior to order fulfillment. When a supplier receives a contract or a purchase order from Citi, it carries the obligation to supply the ordered goods or services at the agreed-upon price and terms. Over the life of a supplier relationship, Citi conducts ongoing monitoring activities. Ongoing monitoring is essential to manage the supplier relationship and any associated risks. Additional information from suppliers may be required as part of our ongoing monitoring efforts. It is critical that the supplier is responsive to all Citi requests in order to avoid delays or avoid cancellation of the engagement with Citi. Citi iSupplier PortalCurrent Citi suppliers can access and enable supplier self-service capabilities and real time interaction and collaboration through the Citi iSupplier Portal.",478
707,"To take advantage of the benefits, suppliers are required to complete the registration process.Citi iSupplier Portal Benefits Visibility to issued purchase orders, invoices, and payment statuses Shorter end-to-end processing cycle time Ability to perform real time updates to contact information, tax, and banking information through self service Citi is in the process of completing this implementation, so availability of the Citi iSupplier Portal may be limited in certain countries at this time. Visit the iSupplier overview site to learn more about the portal, download the on-boarding package, and view training materials. Invoicing (Billing/Payment) As part of our digital transformation, we are moving to a paper-free and fully digitized supply chain ecosystem. We expect our suppliers to issue invoices electronically by utilizing one of our digital invoicing options for billing and payment. For those countries where regulation or law requires a paper invoice, suppliers must submit a hard copy to Citi in addition to the electronic format. Specific payment processing procedures may vary by country according to local statutory and operational requirements. Contact the Service Desk to determine what invoicing options are available for your organization. Direct Electronic Invoicing Direct Electronic Invoicing is Citi's preferred method of invoicing for suppliers with high volume of invoices (500 or more annually). Direct electronic invoicing reduces payment cycle time and improves accuracy. To utilize direct electronic invoicing, suppliers will need to develop an electronic file internally, which conforms to Citi’s electronic file formats. We accept cXML, version 1.2.009, and a Citi custom Flat File format. To initiate the process to implement electronic invoicing for your organization, email p2p.eim@citi.com and a Citi technology expert will contact you to review your electronic invoicing options and next steps. The Citi electronic invoicing onboarding specialist will work closely with your organization through the development and testing phases of the implementation process. Suppliers submitting invoices electronically for countries that have a hard copy regulatory requirement for invoices may require a supplemental process in order to ensure Citi meets this requirement. Citi iSupplier Portal For invoicing, the Citi iSupplier Portal allows you to submit invoices directly into Citi’s Procure to Pay (P2P) system. Suppliers with low invoice volume can take advantage of using the Citi iSupplier Portal for invoice submission generating timelier receipt by Citi. Suppliers can easily access the portal and instantly view invoices and payment status.",493
708,"Visit the Citi iSupplier Portal overview site to learn more about the portal, download the on-boarding package, and view training materials. Standard Invoice Template If electronic invoicing is not an immediate option, Citi is creating a Standard Invoice Template to expedite the submission of paper invoices to Citi for suppliers. This template will be used for all invoices that are not sent through Citi’s preferred electronic invoicing channels, unless otherwise mandated by local country regulatory requirements. The template will provide a standard layout for invoices, dictate usage guidelines, ensure adherence to Citi requirements, and eliminate processing delays due to incomplete or illegible invoice information. Payments Citi’s preferred method of payment to suppliers is Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Our approved Virtual Card Accounts Program described below is also an approved payment method that can be utilized by Citi suppliers in the United States. The Citi Dynamic Discounting Program described below is an option available to Citi suppliers in the United States where they are able to receive accelerated payments in exchange for a negotiated discount. Virtual Card Accounts Payment Program (Only available in the United States) Through the Virtual Card Accounts (VCA) payment program, suppliers can utilize a virtual credit card for payments, instead of existing payment methods (wire transfer, check, ACH, etc.). Suppliers need to accept the proposed terms and register to onboard into the VCA program and modify their payment method in our Procure to Pay (P2P) payment system. Currently, this option is only available in the United States. The advantages of accepting virtual cards as a form of payment include: Receive accelerated payment based on program terms Increase cash flow and working capital benefits Simplify reconciliation, as virtual card transactional data is supplemented with invoice number and other payment reference data Greater control over accounts receivable Transact without the need for new point-of-sale card processing equipment This program is offered in partnership with Citi Commercial Cards.
